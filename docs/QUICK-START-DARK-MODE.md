# Dark Mode Quick Start Guide

## What is Dark Mode?

Dark Mode is a display setting that uses light-colored text and icons on a dark background, making it easier to read in low-light environments and reducing eye strain during extended reading sessions.

## How to Use Dark Mode

### Switching Themes

In the reader header, you'll find three theme buttons:

1. **☀️ Light** - Bright background, dark text (traditional)
2. **🌙 Dark** - Dark background, light text (easier on eyes)
3. **🔄 Auto** - Automatically matches your device settings

Simply click the button for your preferred theme!

### Your Choice is Saved

Once you select a theme, it will be remembered the next time you visit. No need to change it every time!

## When to Use Each Theme

### Light Theme ☀️
- **Best for**: Daytime reading, bright environments
- **Benefits**: High contrast, traditional reading experience
- **Great when**: You're in a well-lit room or outdoors

### Dark Theme 🌙
- **Best for**: Night reading, low-light environments
- **Benefits**: Reduces eye strain, saves battery on OLED screens
- **Great when**: You're reading at night or in dim lighting

### Auto Theme 🔄
- **Best for**: Users who want automatic adjustment
- **Benefits**: Seamlessly switches based on your device settings
- **Great when**: Your device is set to auto dark mode

## Tips for the Best Reading Experience

### Combine with Font Size
Dark mode works great with the font size control! Try:
- Dark theme + Large font for comfortable night reading
- Light theme + your preferred size for daytime

### Reduce Eye Strain
If you read for long periods:
1. Use dark mode in low light
2. Take breaks every 20 minutes
3. Adjust font size to comfortable level
4. Keep screen at arm's length

### Battery Saving
On phones with OLED screens (iPhone X and newer, many Android phones):
- Dark mode can significantly extend battery life
- Black pixels on OLED screens use almost no power
