<h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Mess Hall and Basic Needs</h3>
<p>It filled the air, the smell of food, the feel of it so thick I thought I could grab it. Good food? We were starving, weak in the knees for the want of food. Anything. Stale bread soaked in olive oil, or no oil, or a small piece of meat, any meat, as long as it was well cooked, and not in a fighting mood when I cut into it. A piece of lamb, but beans were likely, as this place seemed like an army kitchen, small and cramped, everything pushed together to make room for too many. But not as clean as an army kitchen, with a hundred men swing brooms and mops at the snap of the captain’s finger. </p>
<p>An old sailor, hunched over, was cleaning off the tables, pushing the garbage into a small pail hung from his right arm, while talking with himself, sometimes laughing, as he moved in as soon as the eaters left, before new eaters could take their place. </p>
<p>The food kettles sat on a long table against the wall, and it was at the end of this table where the line was formed. </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> nudged me, “I hold the table…get me food when you go through the line.” </p>
<p>“Near the door if you can. Do not bury me in the corner, with strangers.” We each took a heavy plate (earthenware, I believe) and a fork and spoon, and a small cup, and I dished out mine and some for <em>Luca</em>. <em>Enzo</em> complained his cup was grimy and rusted inside, but he polished it with a cloth he took from his pocket and seemed satisfied. </p>
<p>“We may need these cups to eat when we get to America,” he said. </p>
<p><em>Santo</em> grabbed a cup. “Eat? From cups? They eat from cups in America?” <em>Enzo</em> laughed, patting <em>Santo’s</em> shoulder, like a cute little boy. </p>
<p>“No. Not eat, <em>Santo</em>…to beg on a corner.” </p>
<p>“Beg?” </p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, beg. <em>Mendicare</em>.” I laughed. I imagine a coin hitting the bottom of the cup. </p>
<p>“<em>Grazie</em>. You are very kind,” I would say, hoping he would throw in another. I smiled, but he walked away. Then I am beaten by a band of <em>brigands</em>, who roam the streets in America, I have been told. I plead. ‘Take my cup. Do not let them find me with it frozen in my hand, and my family will be shamed, and my name will be like a curse in <em>Sicilia</em>. They push me in the river (some river, I do not know its name) and I thanked them for this courtesy. </p>
<p>“<em>Antonino</em>! Wake up. Are you with us?” </p>
<p>The spoons (no forks) were made of soft, black iron, and most were covered with a fine dusting of rust, so I pick through the bin until I found one clean enough to suit me. The guard (the spoon guard) sees me do it, but he looked the other way. Soft iron was a poor choice for these tools, <em>Enzo</em> said, as they rot from the salt in the air, but they were cheap and cheap is efficient. He stepped aside and let a family of four into the line, and I was pissed that he did it, as it caused me a longer wait before I could get at my food. <em>Luca</em> stood guard over our captured table and chased away two men who saw it as empty and fair game, and they tried to claim it for their own use. </p>
<p>We took our meal from three iron pots. Pot one, some kind of beans, green, soaking in oil, maybe water and oil, but not olive oil. I slopped more than a share onto my plate, thinking “once through the line,” was a true and accurate rumor. Pot two, boiled potatoes, rough quartered, in their skin, and no way appealing to me, but I took more than my share. The army fed potatoes every day, cooked any way possible, but mostly boiled. Men from the north ate them raw, with salt, claiming they were a delicacy, and only foolish men ate them cooked, soft, like something fed to a baby. I saw potatoes in my sleep, as the good crops were poor (no rain), and nothing would grow but potatoes. “Potatoes are like weeds,” <em>papa</em> said. “A cup of dirt will grow a thousand of them, anywhere, even between rocks and stone.” I prayed for meat in the last pot, and He heard me, as the last pot contained an odd-looking meat, maybe, but not lamb. It was boiled down hard, cut into thin strips for better digestion, and no civilized man should eat shaved meat, except during long periods of privation. Even the army does not shave the meat, or I do not recall it, or I did not care at the time. It was old goat, I would bet, without the foul smell, unless the smell was boiled away, and the carcass soaked in vinegar for at least a week. I heaped it,(whatever it was) atop the beans and potatoes, sniffing the plate all the way across the room, like a derelict with a handout. I spooned half onto <em>Luca’s</em> plate, and he never bothered to give me a thanks. </p>
<p>“No drink?” he asked, in a manner you would use talking to a fool. “Water would be good, clean water would be better, but wine would be best, and <em>Siclianu</em> wine would be like the gift of life.” </p>
<p>“Water? Where is the water?” I asked of no one in particular, but there was no water, or wine or wine, or anything to drink. Nothing. Two men and two women shared the next table(box); they finished the meal, and the two men drank wine while their women talked quietly. </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> wanted a drink and he decided it would be his, and he cleared a path through a crowded room, raising only minor protests, but his stern look alone quieted the worst of the complainers. He grabbed a sailor by the arm, too vigorously, I think, demanding a drink of something, but this sailor was an eager fighter, and he pulled away, and shook a stick in <em>Luca’s</em> face. The two squared off, but there was no room for a real fight, so what was the use, and they talked it over and no punches were thrown. They blame the error (no water)on a new crewman, who did not bring out the barrel because he was not ordered to bring out the barrel, and he refused to do it on his own. <em>Luca</em> backed away and half assed apologized for grabbing the sailor, who was not gracious, or did he accept the apology, and for the next three or four days, he watched us from the corner of his eye. No water, but we were still God damned hungry and ate whatever we could find, like four stray dogs. The talk at the table was the great meat question, as two of us thought it might be, but bad beef. One said pork, but I said no, thinking it was goat, old goat, not lamb as I always enjoyed. Whatever it was in the other life, I am sure it lived a brutal life and was glad to die. We ate it all, cleaning our plates near dry, agreeing it was the worst meal we ever had, or near the worst meal. Once finished, we started to the door, but the sailor who squared off with <em>Luca</em>, blocked our way, his hand in my face. We were told, harshly, as I recall, to take our plates and forks with us, as only one set was allowed each man. </p>
<p>“One set, no more. If you lose them, you eat with your hands, like apes.” “How do we clean them,” I ask. </p>
<p>“Find a barrel,” he said, in the surly voice of authority. “Clean them. That’s what you do.” </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> was confused. “Drinking water?” he asked, but politely. </p>
<p>“Used water,” he grunted. “What fool uses clean water?” He was an impatient man, and refused to answer another question, insisting we move on, as he pointed to the door. <em>Enzo</em> complained about “chaos,” and people who filled the room, were not the ‘gentle people,’ he was used to. </p>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Lifeboat Debate</h3>

<p>“And what will happen in an emergency, God forbid? We are already underwater…I am not comfortable with this chaos.” We agreed, it was chaos as he said, and we waited, but nothing changed and then I realize the <em>chaos</em> (<em>caos</em>) he spoke of was a bad thing, to be avoided by all civilized men. <em>Luca</em> points to a young boy and girl sleeping at a table, as the mother and father ate, and he thought children were the smart ones, and should be guiding the mother and father. </p>
<p>My energy gone, I could have slept the rest of the day, but it was sometime before noon, I guessed. My lids were heavy, and I fought to keep awake. <em>Santo</em> sees a board on the wall, and pictures of people climbing into small boats, carrying children who seemed happy and content. It was calm and peaceful in these pictures, but I have not seen any calmness or orderliness as of yet, and there has been no emergency. It was not real life these pictures showed; I imagined what it would be like, the screaming and the clawing for a place in the boat, and to hell with everyone else, including women and children, God help us. </p>
<p>“Where are these boats?” <em>Santo</em> asked me, but I shrugged it off, as I had no answer. </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> stood so close to the board, his nose touched it, and I realize he had trouble seeing things, but this he ignored me. “Indeed,” he said. “There should be enough boats for all the crew and passengers.” </p>
<p><em>Santo</em> agreed. “Thank God for that. I do not want to survive if all of you are dead,” but who believed it, as it is something said but never meant. </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> shook his head. “Do not be confident you will die, my good man. I am certain there are a few boats…I saw a few boats…but not enough for every passenger.” <em>Santo</em> puts his hand in the air, like a schoolboy would ask a question. </p>
<p>“<em>Enzo</em>, how is it decided who gets the boat if there are not enough?” </p>
<p>“God has already decided. The biggest and the strongest will have them, or they will do their best to take them.” </p>
<p>“And the rest of us?” </p>
<p>“<em>Morte</em>,” <em>Enzo</em> answered, staring solemn at the floor. </p>
<p>A spit shined officer ordered us to move on. </p>
<p>“No blocking the corridor,” he demanded. We grumble under our breath, but obeyed and walked away, stopping when he disappeared into the dining hall. <em>Enzo</em> scratched at the stubble on his chin. </p>
<p>“What were we talking about? Yes, the boats.” He thought. “I am familiar with the law of the sea, and it demands that women and children are always first into the boats, since they are the weakest. Then men, if there is room, and in some cases, a few will be chosen by the officers. I understand this from my reading, and, of course, the crew will be last, except the men who will steer and operate the lifeboats. The captain stays until the very end, and it is expected, if he must, that he will go down with the ship. It is the honorable thing to do.” <em>Luca</em> stares at <em>Enzo</em>. </p>
<p>“My ass,” he said, grabbing his own. “When is the boss ever been last?” </p>
<p><em>Santo’s</em> face was white, and his mouth hung open. Except for the captain and the crew, who should be last, he did not think it fair that it is only by accident we are men, and for this we are third in line to be saved, after the women and children? “Not fair, at all,” he said. </p>
<p>To the rule, that the crew would be last, <em>Luca</em> laughed. “This scurvy looking crew of <em>brigands</em> will most likely throw the children overboard, as they are the weakest and easily beaten.” </p>
<p>“You are such a cynical man.” <em>Enzo</em> said. </p>
<p>“Cynical (<em>cinico</em>)” I have not heard this word before. </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> then disrespected the law of the sea, saying he would not obey it if the boat started to sink. He pointed to the floor, “If we go down…everybody for themselves. Any man who wants my seat will have to take it away from me with a bigger gun,” and at that he patted his rear pocket, the place he carried the pistol, but adding, he would not take a seat from a friend, or any old man, or any child, and not from a woman, but to this he would not swear. </p>
<p><em>Santo</em> made the sign of the cross. <em>Enzo</em> was shook by what he heard. </p>
<p>“My God, where is the <em>chivalry</em>? When I was young, any man would gladly give his life to save a woman.” </p>
<p>“Bullshit!” <em>Luca</em> said, loud, and anyone in the corridor looked, but was he embarrassed? </p>
<p>He grabbed <em>Enzo</em> by the sleeve. </p>
<p>“When you look death in the eye, how far will you go to save yourself? How immoral will you be?” <em>Enzo</em> stared. </p>
<p>A fair question, I thought, surprised <em>Luca</em> would say it. </p>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">Finding the Card Room</h3>

<p>How far would I go to save my worthless ass? If I could answer this question, what else was there be to know about myself? Would I beat a woman, or run a wagon over a helpless child? If I did either, how long would it be before I forgot the truth of what happened and start telling the story in a way it made me seem a hero? A young woman, who was carrying a child (a boy) shifted him to her left arm, making the sign of the cross with her right hand. There was a silence, except for the noise of the engines. <em>Santo</em> cleared his throat. </p>
<p>“Some men would trample their mothers…the bastards,” and a young woman catching some of what was said, looked away. </p>
<p>“We are all afraid,” I said, and <em>Enzo</em> agreed with me. “Yes, it is true. All chaotic. Very chaotic.” </p>
<p>Disagreements and fights, something I have always avoided, like death, my whole life. I am not a coward, as it might seem to another man who does not know me, or thinks I am too cautious, like an old man because of his age. <em>Mio amico</em>, <em>Luca Ponto</em>, on the other hand, enjoys the battle, the smell of sweat and fear, and me, I would rather watch it from a hilltop, or running east, if the battle is moving west. This is cowardly only if you are fighting for yourself and have started the battle at a time and place of your own choosing and you are free to leave at will. A soldier cannot be a coward as he is not free to leave. This I believe to be true, like night follows day. </p>
<p>Four rowdy men pushed their way down the corridor to where we stood, and stopped and waited for us to move, and finally the biggest and toughest looking made it an order. This boat, as I can tell, is full of rude and angry people. It seemed these men moved at us on order of a low and common sailor who wore a band on his right arm, with writing I could not read. We were not blocking the way, as he said, but in any case, we submitted, like good <em>contadini</em>, and <em>Enzo</em> was right and correct in this advice. Even the fighter, <em>Luca</em>, moved without argument. </p>
<p>Life is easier, better, if you are obedient, but you will always think of yourself as shit. How to pass the time? Walk the halls? Get our asses kicked by every sailor and officer. “Move on. You are in the way,” or “head back to your beds.” </p>
<p>A man, who smelled of fuel oil, with streaks of thick grease on his face, stood at the end of this particular corridor, a small cigar hanging from his mouth. <em>Santo</em> asked him, respectfully, “is there a place we can talk or play cards?” He coughed and wiped his nose with his sleeve. </p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, there is. Up one deck, then go aft, not forward.” At the back of the boat, he explained, we would find a room where we can sit, play cards, or drink wine if we had it. A good place to be lazy, he said, in the way I believed he enjoyed idleness, that is comfortable for some, but too much is a vice, an evil, like sin, to be avoided. The benefit to idleness is that there is no need for a boss, and maybe just two weeks of freedom from these bastards, might mean the beginning of a new life. I will enjoy this freedom, if it is freedom, and if it is not freedom, then what is the harm? No <em>capu</em> lording over my shoulder, taunting me, “kiss my ass, young man, to keep your job, and the stable were you and your family sleep. More work, give me more work, or you are out.” This is heaven, or as close to heaven as I will get. I grew to be a man, never lingering, or being idle, with no time to call my own, “Relax when you die,” <em>papa</em> said, but he smiled. “Now I have work for you to do when you have finished work for the day.” If he was standing here, what would I say to <em>papa’s</em> face? He is the pattern from which I was made. We are each other; the same blood, the same thought on most everything. </p>
<p>I am too sentimental and sometimes think like a woman, to my embarrassment. I hear my name. “<em>Antonino</em>, where are you? Somewhere else?” </p>
<p>Half the boat is ‘<em>Antonino</em>.’ Maybe I am daydreaming. “No…I am here. Where else would I be?” </p>
<p>We climbed the narrow stairs, iron stairs, not wood stairs, wide enough for one man, and we fight against a line of people coming down at the same time. At the top we loitered, wondering where we were. <em>Enzo</em> read aloud a small and faded sign. “<em>A destra</em>,” he said, plainly. My new rule: only follow men who can read the signs. </p>
<p>“We have landed in second class,” <em>Enzo</em> said. “Yes. I am sure. This is second class.” </p>
<p>The floors were clean, and the air smelled of fresh paint and the walls were brushed smooth, no runs, no streaks, no sags. Through an open door, we see a small room for two or three people, or a small family, not a common room, like a barracks or a meeting hall. A second class room. Second class is better than steerage, but not as good as first class. Lucky bastards are people who travel in Second Class, but not as lucky as people who travel in First Class. We were afraid of being where we were; second class, when only we paid for third class, so we moved on toward the end of the ship, in a long and narrow hallway. A woman in the middle years, a <em>contadina</em> by her look and manners, was talking to a prosperous young man, but they were not together. She was lost, to be sure, and confused, and he said, politely, and pointing to the stairs, “third class is one deck down.” His dialect was strong, from <em>il nord</em>, I believe, and I wondered why he came South to take a boat. Distances cannot be judged in such poor light, but I guess we walked, maybe, two hundred feet, all together, in this passageway, not more than three feet wide. People coming from where we were going, kicked and elbowed, because we were in the spot they wanted to be. Expect an elbow in the eye, or a kick in the leg, or higher. We found the room that was described to us, and <em>Enzo</em> claimed to be familiar with these places, as he taught school in England, and his hotel had a room, where only men were allowed, and they played cards and drank wine and <em>grappa</em>, and told stories not fit to be told in front of women, or within earshot. <em>Papa</em> would not approve of such things. </p>
<p>“We drank hard and cursed often,” <em>Enzo</em> said, “but I enjoyed my time.” </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em>? Curse? I did the same things he mentioned, the drinking, the stories, some cursing, but in the <em>piazza</em> after work, maybe Sunday mass, if I went, and there were no women, who were mostly at home preparing the meal and cleaning. </p>
<p>This room was wide and high, about thirty feet long and the width of the ship at the rear. But these dimensions I guessed at, by pacing off the steps, three feet to each pace, as this was the way to measure in <em>Sicilia</em>. Two cabins would fit easily between the walls, and we thought it was decent to give up paying space, so we could play cards and drink wine, or <em>grappa</em> if we had it, as I do not believe it was sold on the boat. A bare room, except for tables and chairs, not like the room where we were fed, and forced to sit on empty boxes. These tables were round and efficient, as more men can be sat at a round table. Oak, but unpainted, with four or five chairs each, laid out in no ordered way. A short length of rope was nailed to the underside of each table, then passed through an iron eye, bolted to the floor, as a good way to keep things from moving in bad weather. The room was near empty, to my surprise; only four men playing cards, drinking and making some noise, while at a separate table four women waited, talking amongst themselves. I did not expect women, as they should not be allowed in this area, but given their own room where they could watch the children. A sailor, no more than a boy, neatly stacked boxes in a corner of the room, each box in line with the box below it. His neatness and attention to work impressed <em>Enzo</em>. </p>
<p>“Military precision,” he declared. </p>
<p>“He takes pride, even the simple task of stacking boxes.” Me? I did not see the beauty of it. </p>
<p>“Stacking boxes is not art, but in a way, it is a lost art,” he said. </p>
<p>A board hung on the wall, near hidden by a pile of ten poorly stacked boxes What use did I have for words, if I could not read? </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em>, always curious, inspected the board, his nose sometimes touching the paper, and I understood could not see good, and prayed this was the worst of his infirmities. </p>
<p>“What does it say?” I ask. </p>
<p>“This notice here, let’s see,” he pointed to the picture of a boat, “it is our…our…let’s see…our estimated arrival in America.” He squinted, then turned his head sideways, stepped back, then closer. “Yes. That’s it. And I see these notes are written in long hand by someone,” he paused and scratched at his chin. “By someone schooled in Genova. I can see by the slant of the letters.” The board was set back in the shadows, and <em>Enzo</em> stepped aside and squinted his eyes. “Yes, definitely, I recognize it as <em>Genovan…Genovan</em>. I am certain of it.” He took his pair of well-worn spectacles from his pocket, round lenses, trimmed in brass, with a bent bow that he straightened it. He breathed on the lenses, wiped them dry with a small handkerchief, and fumbled as he struggled to set them precisely on the bridge of his nose. They hung too far down, as I could see, and he tilted his head back to focus on the board. He shook his head. </p>
<p>“Shameful scribbling, and the penmanship is disgraceful…these <em>Genovans</em> write like ignorant <em>contadini</em>,” and when he said it, I was insulted, but let it pass, as I was not certain who he meant. He slowly turned and stared from the corner of his eye, pushing the spectacles up the bridge of his nose, from where they slipped again. He cleared his throat. </p>
<p>“<em>Chiedo scusa</em>. My apologies to all of you. Of course I did not mean you men, but I fear it sounded that way.” He turned back to the board and continued to read, and he made no other mention of ‘ignorant <em>contadini</em>.’ </p>
<p>“It says,” and he squinted and moved closer, “it says we will arrive at New York Harbor in fourteen days, if all goes well. Two weeks. Maybe three with bad weather.” He cleaned the lens, again, with his jacket sleeve, saying plainly, he needed a new pair, as they were weak and old and the lens were scratched, and the bows were bent too many times. He gazed at the board, as if in a trance. </p>
<p>“Very difficult to read with bad spectacles,” he said, as he moved in another step. </p>
<p>“But we should land March 7th. About three in the afternoon if these people are correct.” <em>Santo</em> tapped his finger on the board, “So we dock…what then <em>Enzo</em>?” </p>
<p>“What then? Then we shall see what all the fuss is about.” “And where do we go?” </p>
<p>“Where we like.” </p>
<p>I punch <em>Santo’s</em> arm, gently, not to make him angry. “Did you forget our plan?” </p>
<p>“I did not forget,” he said. “Am I <em>stupdio</em>?” And for show, no other reason, he repeats the plan we made months ago. </p>
<p>“We get off the boat and find the train to <em>Siracusa</em>. We meet up with cousin, <em>Natale</em>, if he shows, because he has promised us work on the steam road. The three of us, we save our money, live on shit, like back home. In a few years we will have money…we go home and buy our own land…be our own <em>capu</em>. But if this place does not want us, we say <em>va' fa' un culo</em> to all of you,” and leave the next day. He smiled, thinking he had won, proving he was no <em>stupido</em>. </p>
<p>“Did I pass?” </p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, you did,” and together we smiled, and it was at that moment I remember my promise to <em>Carmela</em>, that I would call for her if America was to my liking and she would come and my family will come. Why go back, with a pocket full of <em>lire</em> and great thoughts, when the stronger men, the men with more <em>lira</em> and bigger thoughts, will steal what I have? Like a hundred years ago and no different. </p>
<p><em>Santo</em> wiped the sweat off his hands on the front of his jacket. “I am worried about <em>Natale</em>. What if he does not show? What then? It has been months since we heard from him.” What if…what if…what if? </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> took his arm. “Too many ifs, but in that case we will all swim back to <em>Sicilia</em>.” We laughed, except <em>Santo</em>, who has never laughed in his life. </p>
<p>“You are foolish people,” he said, and turned away. </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> lifted the spectacles from his nose and took another step closer to the board. </p>
<p>“Listen to this, my friends” He squinted at the board. “German Maritime Law demands this ship carry twenty lifeboats, or sometimes more.” </p>
<p>“Did you read the rule correct,” I ask. He did and it made no sense. </p>
<p>“Twenty lifeboats for more than a thousand?” He agreed it was not enough, and many might drown, and that would be a tragedy, but <em>Enzo</em> was no professional seaman, with no education or special training in these matters. </p>
<p>Only twenty boats? <em>Luca</em> was confused. </p>
<p>“I saw, maybe, ten, and one had a hole in the side the size of <em>Santo’s</em> head. Another had a missing plank. That is eight.” </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> scratches his chin. </p>
<p>“This does not seem right. My friends, we have a complaint, of sorts. Not enough boats, and at least two need major repair.” He cleared his throat. “Legitimate grievances, I believe.” </p>
<p>We heard later, from some ‘salt’ as they like to call themselves, there was a method to the calculation, that if this boat goes down, many will drown and have no need for a lifeboat, leaving the rest for the living. He was an old fool. </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> gets in close, at the bottom of the board, and reads the very small print, underneath the small print. </p>
<p>“It says plainly, we are allowed to complain to the “German Maritime Ministry” in Berlin. I shall write them in the morning.” He said this foolishly, as a joke, and we all laughed, but not <em>Santo</em>. We would have laughed at anything, short of our own pain, but certainly the pain of others. No. Not our own pain. I am certain of it. And, as I say, <em>Santo</em> never laughs, and <em>Luca</em>, only sometime. Me? I laugh. What do I know? </p>
<p>A man stood in a group of men playing cards, shouts from across the room. “What is the joke, my friend? Tell us. We can use a laugh over here.” </p>
<p>So, <em>Enzo</em> read the notice again, now with vigor, feeling he was on display and the men playing cards desired their entertainment. They laughed as they raised their cups and praised Berlin. They stood and one offered a toast, that all on the boat will arrive in America safely and he promised he would pray to <em>San Rocco</em> and say a <em>Novena</em> every week for a year, at the great Catholic Church in New York City, that he did not name, but <em>Enzo</em> said he meant Saint <em>Patricks</em> Cathedral. The man admitted fearing for his family, but regrettably he brought no stamps for a letter of complaint, should the boat sink to the bottom of the sea. We laughed and applauded his joke, and he turned red from the attention and maybe too much wine. These men were four farmers from <em>Calabria</em>, out of work, with nothing to lose, and decided one night they would try America for a while. They shared what they felt, and one wept, confessing he left them all behind, and would say nothing more about it. They did not offer to share their wine, but when they had all finished their drink, each waved, said <em>ci vediamo</em>, and left the room. The last man, the man who wept in front of other men, staggered and I thought of offering a hand, but out of respect, I did not. </p>
<p>The energy from the joking and the stories told was gone, and a great fatigue se. I could barely stand, as my legs wobbled as they sometimes do on a drunk. We took a table and tried to relax, watching people wander through the door, alone, by two’s, whole families, looking for a good seat to set in and pass the time. A good seat is important in these things, and what is better than relaxing when there is nothing to do, and you are spared that guilty feeling of laziness. </p>
<p>Fourteen days of this, or more. God help me, I have not been idle fourteen days since I learned to walk. Is it natural and good, or is it <em>Blasphemy</em>? </p>
<p>A man alone was leaning against the wall, for almost an hour, and seemed embarrassed he had nothing to do, and for this he played with his fingers, like the crazy man back home, <em>Giuseppe Monti</em>, who stood all day in the <em>piazza</em> (but only in good weather) playing with his fingers, saying kind things to everyone who passed. </p>
<p>This room were found, a room made for drinking wine and <em>grappa</em> (but they did not serve it) and playing cards, and cursing, yet women and children were allowed. A well-lit room, by eight oil lamps in all, but two were near empty and smoking, sending ribbons of soot into the air. Two men sat quietly at a small corner table, smoking cigars and the smoke, God damn them, floated across our table, and I started coughing and slapping at my chest. They stopped smoking and butted their cigars, but soon they were smoking again. </p>
<p>What man makes another man sick and will not see the wrong in it? </p>
<p>I asked <em>Luca</em> if this particular room was below the water line? He said plainly, without giving it much thought, why would he care, as long as the walls and ceiling and floor did not leak. Instead of being concerned, as I was, he took a deck of cards from his shirt pocket and pushed it across the table. “We should play some cards, no?” </p>
<p>“Cards? “I would rather hide in the dark, like some child, than play games right now,” <em>Luca</em> slapped the table, and it shook, as the legs were loose. He looked square at me, shaking his head. </p>
<p>“Playing cards, my friend, is how <em>Sicilian</em> men have passed the time for a thousand year.” No matter. I saw it as a waste of life, nothing more. Better a man runs in circles, like a crazy dog trying to catch his tail. Or small talk, and I have always hated small talk. But to <em>Luca</em>, to my father, most men, a card game is like war, but without the risks and the blood and the death. War with rules everyone must obey, that a civilized man can believe in and feel good about, with no chance to suffer, except for what he loses and any debt he might make to the winner. This, they say, is what makes cards a good and honorable pastime. But that was then, I was a child, but my opinions have changed since the days I played pitch and <em>briscola</em> and saw them as games children play. Today is the second day; tonight, will be the second night, but it is really the first day, as we came on the boat after midnight. First day, second day; I miss feeling the heat of sun, so hot it can burn the eyes and sear the flesh. </p>
<p><em>Santo</em> brooded, complaining he should not have left his wife behind, and as God as his judge, he missed her. He has always believed he suffers alone, and that makes him feel good in some way. <em>Luca</em> just sat and watched, lusting after every woman who walked by, yet none were as beautiful as the women back home, so he said. Not one. <em>Enzo</em>, the teacher, counseled (his word) that we make the best of this idle time. I ask myself for the hundredth time, am I doing the right thing? Will there be a better place than here? Many go over and come back, cursing America. Is it right I left my family to their own? I felt sick upstairs, in my head. We stood four grown men, weeping together, and today is worse than yesterday. I left them to wander the boat, getting lost in a maze of corridors and hallways. I came across a man sitting on a step, praying the “Our Father,” and I believe he was crying, but he looked away and I could not swear for certain. He stood, excused himself for blocking the stairs. He was <em>Giuseppe</em>…I cannot recall his last name…from <em>Castellemmare del Golfo</em>, <em>Sicilia</em>, in the west of my country. </p>
<p>“I was praying when you came on me,” he said. “To our patron, <em>San Rocco</em>, for peace and guidance.” After a time of small talk, he passed on a rumor he heard from a man in his cabin, who claimed it came from a crewman, that steerage would not be allowed on deck during the trip across. </p>
<p>“For our safety,” he said, and scoffed. “My ass…we will die down here.” </p>
<p>“But they promised,” I said. “We would be allowed on deck for sun and fresh air.” “They said this to your face, or you heard it and it is bad information?” </p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, to my face when we bought our tickets. How can they keep us here, like animals in a pen? My God, it is not civilized.” He shook his head. </p>
<p>“Civilized? You said ‘civilized?” He laughed and scratched at his chin and wiped his forehead with a rag he took from his pocket. “There is food and water down here, they will say. A place to eat, a place to sleep and shit, and some have brought their own women…what else is there? Only two weeks. Maybe three, if the weather is bad. This is what they will say.” </p>
<p>“But what is the purpose in this?” I ask. </p>
<p>“For our own good, they say. The seas are high this time of year and the deck is dangerous. Men, drunk ones and sober ones, have gone over the side and they say this will stop it.” </p>
<p>“Is it only third class?” </p>
<p>“What do you think,” he answered. He swore he knew nothing more, or did he know if the rumor was true, and no more than the grumbling of a discontented crewman looking to make trouble. But he believed it. </p>
<p>How could this be true? A thousand <em>Italiani</em> held captive on the whim of one man? A German man, no less? I chose to ignore it, as no more than a rumor, or it would drive me crazy. I wished <em>Giuseppe</em> well and wandered back to the room, to see the three of them still complaining, the only change <em>Luca</em> had shifted his body to the right and <em>Santo</em> was leaning back in his chair. <em>Enzo</em> was sleeping, or faking sleep, I could not tell for certain, but he stirred when I walked past and he rubbed his eyes, and said, “you are back.” </p>
<p>I repeat <em>Giuseppe’s</em> story and they were surprised. </p>
<p><em>C'è vero nelle piccole voci grandi</em>. </p>
<p>“There is sometimes great truth in small rumors.” <em>Enzo</em> claimed this to be the wisdom he gave his students when he taught in <em>Roma</em>, and other great cities. But I swear, I heard it from my grandfather, when I was no more than a boy. </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> waved the deck in my face; the devils deck <em>Patri Carmine</em> called it. “Put up your money,” he says. “Take a chance. Get your blood moving.” </p>
<p>I was broke, no money, or did anyone have money, but <em>Enzo</em>, who refused to play cards, or any game of chance, claiming it not to be a civilized pastime. </p>
<p>“Not for me,” I said, pushing the deck away. “I am going to the barracks. My vines need tending. A little water would suit them.” <em>Luca</em> leaned forward, halfway across the table. </p>
<p>“Your vines? Is that what you said…your vines?” He threw the deck on the table and asked for any man to step up, and no one did. “My respects to your vines, <em>Antonino</em>, but I also need a little tending. <em>Capisce, mio amico</em>? Do me this favor when on your travels and find <em>Luca</em> a young lady who is bored, or maybe two, one old, one young. No matter to me.” </p>
<p>This was the time I did not like him much, my good friend <em>Luca</em>. </p>
<p>The sailor guarding the door; a polite man, it seemed, but not clean or well kept. His job, as I could tell, was to greet passengers as they passed, tipping his head, sometimes his cap, to the females. His dress was worn and not a regular sailor’s uniform, but close to it, like some cadet, or other man in training. He was no young man, but he seemed to pass muster. </p>
<p>“<em>Bongiornu</em>,” he said, tipping his cap to me, politely, as if I was a woman, but I was not insulted by it. I pointed to the table where my friends sat. </p>
<p>“<em>Scusa</em>, we are passengers. Well, you know that” and I was embarrassed at my stupidity. “Can you tell me, where is the good water?” He smiled, courteously and nodded. </p>
<p>“Ah, <em>si</em>, water. In your cabin by now. A problem with delivery at the dock, but it has been straightened out, as I have been told.” </p>
<p>“<em>Grazie</em>, thank you. We are all very thirsty.” </p>
<p>He thrust his finger in front of his nose, shaking it, almost violently. </p>
<p>“But watch the side of the barrel. If it says ‘<em>non potabile</em>,’ do not drink it. It will make you sick, worse, maybe dead. It has happened, God rest their souls,” and he bowed his head and made the sign of the cross (piously), and I did the same, out of habit and not respect, as I did not know the dead people he mentioned. He enjoyed talking and our dialects were close, but not the same, yet I mostly understood what he said. He was older, maybe ten years, but he seemed, in all other things, to be an old man. Maybe he was some sort of mechanic, trained in small repairs and other adjustments to machinery. This was my guess, but I never asked. His complaint, that after many years of service he became a guard, that was never to his liking; he felt like a jailer and his father would be ashamed and disown him, except if he worked the first-class floor, even second class, but not steerage. He has complained about it, and many other things, he admitted; he was not satisfied with his assignments or his work and the way he was treated. Each time he complained, about anything, he was given duty in steerage. “Our boat, our rules,” they told him, and he finally learned his lesson. Now he spouts his complaints to the crew and not the bosses, but he believes there are spy’s who inform. “Dirty bastards,” as he called them. I felt like he did, though we were strangers, as I suffered for complaining on working conditions, lust a few months before the army took me away. <em>Zio Angelo</em> (my mother’s brother) was a troublemaker, himself; he swore I was drafted by some order of the <em>capu</em>, because of my complaints. When I come home after two years, “no work for you,” the bosses said, and I was sent away. <em>Zio Angelo</em> was a fool and not to be believed (my mother said this to me). </p>
<p>“I am sorry for your troubles,” I tell this guard. “I wish you luck with your bosses.” He thanked me for my concern. </p>
<p>“Maybe you can answer me another question?” I asked. </p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, of course, <em>signore</em>, this is why I am here.” He smiled and now I felt comfortable. “A simple question on the rumors I have heard. Do you know when we will be allowed on deck?” He scratched his chin. </p>
<p>“First, you should not trust rumors, <em>signore</em>. On a boat, rumors are mostly lies made up by idle men. But this rumor I can say is true. The deck is off limits to steerage passengers.” </p>
<p>“But we need fresh air. Some way to stretch our legs.” He rolled his head and cleared his throat, in the way men do when they intend to say something not to your liking. </p>
<p>“Well,” he said, slowly and drawing the word out. “That may not be so easy...you see...” </p>
<p>Before he could finish, I interrupt. “We are already choking on this shit air. It has a color to it. Green, or gray. I cannot tell. What color is it, anyway?” </p>
<p>“It is true,” he said. “Passengers complain about the air, every trip. But getting on deck, for you in steerage, will be near impossible this trip. The seas are treacherous, there are too many passengers, and the cargo will be…” </p>
<p>“Should we see an officer?” I said, hoping he would not be insulted. He cautiously searched the corridor, to be honest, like a criminal planning a crime. </p>
<p>“I would like to help, but they are watching me, this captain and his god damned henchmen. He is <em>tedesco</em>, German, barely civilized. He hates us, the <em>Calabrese</em> and <em>Siciliani</em>, I have heard him say it. We are all criminals to this man. I am forced to guard the doors down here, sometimes a hallway, or an empty room, like a goddamn fool. ‘Who better to watch criminals, than other criminals,’ I hear him say. I believe they will kick me off this ship in <em>Barcellona</em>. They ha…” He stopped cold, in the middle of a word, when he saw an officer walking our way, strutting, like a cock bird. The officer ignored him as he pushed between us, sticking an elbow in my ribs, offering no apology. He went on and joined two men at a large table pushed against the wall. They embraced him, like family, offering him the best chair. </p>
<p>This guard scoffed. <em>Luciano Mavesi</em> was his name. Now I remember clearly. </p>
<p>“See this, I am barely human to these people.” I said nothing, as his battle was not my battle, if it was truly a battle, and not his imagination because he did not get from them what he wanted. </p>
<p>“Let me warn you,” he said, watching the officer at the table. “You threatened to complain. Many say it, few do it. Think of what it will cost you.” The officer turned and stare at <em>Luciano</em>, and this caused <em>Luciano</em> to sweat and move away from the line of sight. </p>
<p>“Do not waste your breath, <em>signuri</em>,” he whispered. “When there is a complaint, any complaint, they say the same thing. ‘We will see,’ or ‘no one else has complained.’ If that fails to cool you, they say, ‘the captain will not be happy.’ Mostly you will shut up and go away. If not, if you make too much trouble, they put you off the boat, like they will most likely put me off the boat in <em>Barcelona</em>.” </p>
<p>“Put off for making a complaint? How is this possible?” How is this possible?” He shakes his finger in the air. </p>
<p>“It has been done. I have seen it.” I study his face, and the look of it was honest, and I believed what he said. Complaining no longer seemed a good idea, and when he offered to report my complaint, I said “what complaint…. there is no complaint…just a question. Everything is fine for us. We will think about it.” </p>
<p>He smiled. “<em>Si</em>, yes, think about it.” He laughed. “Think a long time, for your own good. But on every trip, passengers complain. The food, the air, all the conditions. Every time they get the same answer. <em>Niente</em>. Nothing. No answer. They wait for you to go away, and you will. Of course, if you are in first class, even second class, they say ‘drop your pants,’ yours is the ass we love to kiss.’” </p>
<p>Another time I would have laughed at his joke. “But the women and children, they cough and rattle all night, and the old ones are suffering. Something is wrong with the air.” <em>Luciano</em> agreed, but he was a nobody. </p>
<p>“The ventilation pipes, they have not been cleaned out for years, or repaired. They send the filthy air back into the cabins. This was a cargo ship for years, until carrying people was profitable. Cargo needs no air, and crew are not people, so the ventilation pipes are never important. The captain and officers live on another level of the ship, surrounded by clean air. </p>
<p>These pipes in steerage are full of dead animals, rats and other vermin, they say. On the last crossing, near a hundred came up sick. Who counts the crew? The heat, the dirty air was too much for them. Women and children are always hit hard.” </p>
<p>“The boat has a doctor?” He scowled, then laughed. </p>
<p>“No, no doctor. An old army medic. Drunk most of the time.” He laughed, again. “If it is serious, or he is too drunk, they look for a real doctor. If there is one on board, the smart ones will lie and lay low in first class.” </p>
<p>“But the sick recovered. <em>Ē vero</em>?” </p>
<p>“All but two or three. Maybe four. I cannot recall. It is always the old ones, and the children, and he made the sign of the cross. “The poor children,” he said. He did not seem sincere to me; not honest. Who would not say the same about children? Poor things. Helpless. </p>
<p>“What do they do with them, uh, once they are…” </p>
<p>“Over the side,” he said, making motions with his hands. “After a while, they will stink. Buried at sea. And do not miss it if you have the chance. Very dignified.” “What do the families know?” </p>
<p>“If it is their children, of course the know right away. Passengers alone, or with no family is different. If anyone asks, ‘<em>Mi dispiace</em>, but they did not make it.’ What else can we say? Most of the time no one will meet the boat, so no one knows. The poor bastards leave home and are never seen again. Death is God’s decision, not the owners. Blame Him. But they will not say it. Everyone knows what it means. We did all we could do…if anyone asks, that is what they say.” </p>
<p>“But my question. The deck? Why are we not…” He checked the crowded corridor. “Ah, <em>si</em>. Your stroll in the sun….They promised, and you want what is coming to you.” I hated his sarcasm, as it made me feel like a man who has been fooled. </p>
<p>“Now for the truth, and there a more than one. Two, exactly. We take on a little cargo in <em>Barcelona</em>. Freight is money. <em>I soldi parlano</em> (money talks). and I believe it and so should you.” He rubbed the tips of this fingers together and said it again. “Money talks. <em>I soldi parlano</em>. </p>
<p>Freight eats nothing. It never complains, but it needs space…your space, my space. You and your warm friends will be where there is room for freight, so they will load it on the deck, in every place possible, piled as high as they dare, leaving not a free foot for Third Class passengers to have their stroll in the sun. First class and Second Class, they pay for this privilege. But not Third Class. You are too many.” </p>
<p>“But the deck is empty. Why do they keep us down here?” </p>
<p>“If I must tell you, I will if you insist. To be honest, the good paying passengers do not want to see you on the deck…you are like vermin to them and you smell. This is what they say, not me. If you were decent and honorable people, you would not be in steerage.” He said it straight at me, right in my eye, like he had said it a hundred times before. “Third Class are like rats, all over the place. The owners profit as much on the few in first class and second class, as they do in all of Third Class. And they are better people, more civilized, so they cause few problems. And they do not want to see you or be on the same deck with you, or God forbid accidental touch when in a crowd. God forbid. You are vermin to them. That is what they say, not me. This cargo you hate that will be piled on the deck pays for the part of your fare you do not pay, so you will not be allowed to take its space. It makes sense if you think about it.” </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> jumps in and argues with the guard, that the wealthy pay no one’s way anywhere, and to this I agreed. I was disappointed by what this guard says, because I realized he bitched about the powerful, but he was one of them in his head. The worst kind of poor man; rich and powerful in his fantasies. When I first heard him speak and complain about his treatment, I figured we were the same men in different clothes, but his attitude, for all his troubles, was nothing but contempt for me. This I could not understand. In a way we were twins, at least under the skin; what happens to me happens to him, or so I thought. The way he said, ‘Third Class,’ and ‘steerage,’ he would always be one of them in his head, and no matter what they did...e will support them until the day he dies. Now I felt no pity. Fuck him. Put him over the side. Like the dead bodies, he deserved to be buried at sea. Why wait for <em>Barcelona</em>? I kissed his ass, but so gently, enough that I could use him if I needed him. </p>
<p>“Sit and talk when you have time.” I said with a straight face, </p>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Boss's Philosophy</h3>

<p>He refused. “The rules,” he said, “allow only officers to sit with first class passengers, in the first-class hall.” He apologized, that he meant no disrespect. “But the rules.” I said I understood and wished him <em>buona fortuna</em>, and to this lie I added we would pray they would not put him off at <em>Barcelona</em>. I return to the table; they were arguing on the quality of wines. <em>Enzo</em> counted French wine as the best wine, in his opinion, but Italian wines were fine in their own way. The French have superior grapes, he said, firmer, better tended, and this gave the wine “strength” and “endurance.” These words I had not heard before when speaking of wine. <em>Luca</em> argued this point, he had not tasted French wine, or would he, but it was certain to him these wines were like piss water, if they were French. </p>
<p>“The worst <em>Sicilian</em> wine is better than the best French wine. Piss water,” he repeated. </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> and <em>Santo</em> agreed, and <em>Luca</em> said it again, that he never drank French wine, or would he. In <em>Enzo’s</em> mind, <em>Luca’s</em> attack on French wine was an attack on him. </p>
<p>“My good man,” he says to <em>Luca</em>, with a pompous, arrogant tone of voice, “Have you been outside of <em>Italia</em> in your life? No, I think, but I have been in every country of Europe, even welcomed at the Court of <em>St. James</em>.” </p>
<p>“So, you know important judges?” <em>Luca</em> asks. “Judges?” </p>
<p>“<em>Santo Giacomo</em>. If he has a court, then he is a judge. No?” </p>
<p>“Judge? He is no judge. Not that kind of court. I have been…” <em>Enzo</em> tapped the table to get <em>Luca’s</em> attention. </p>
<p>“The big man sitting alone, a couple of tables behind you. He is smoking a cigar.” <em>Luca</em> turned and stared at the man. “<em>Si</em>. What about him?” </p>
<p>“Last night...on the deck. He asked about you.” </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> hunches his shoulders. “About me? I have never seen him before.” Using <em>Santo’s</em> body as a shield, he leaned forward for a better look. <em>Enzo</em> cleared his throat and loosened his collar. </p>
<p>“Well, he did not ask about you, not exactly. He is from <em>Palermu</em>, a businessman, he said, during an innocent conversation. He asked if we knew a good man, not afraid to get dirty.” He shuffled in his seat and scratched at his neck (a sore from an insect from our walk down the mountain). “I thought he was talking about sweat and physical labor. We,” he paused, “No. In honesty, I mentioned your name. I cannot say why, as I barely know you or anything about you. I hear you are a brawler, not afraid to fight...get hurt. That part he liked the best, that you are not afraid to, well, bleed.” <em>Enzo</em> wiped his palms across the legs of his trousers. “I drank too much of his wine. My damn mouth would not stop. What he wants, what he says, he needs men to work in America. For his business.” </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> showed some interest. “What business? Is he a farmer? A landowner?” <em>Enzo</em> chose his words carefully, like a priest, like a politician would do. </p>
<p>“I am not certain of his business, but he is an aggressive man, very aggressive. The kind who will not take ‘no’ for an answer. He promised to find you and speak about his plans. I could tell he is obsessed at knowing what men are made of. He asked me a hundred times, “what is he made of,” meaning you. I should have left, but he was intimidating, and I did not want to disrespect him after he shared ” </p>
<p>I watched and listened but said nothing. <em>Conte</em> sat straight up in the chair, like a king, sure of himself and his power, that he could rule anything he touched. I see his face that was cruel, and this fascinated <em>Luca</em>, and he pesters <em>Enzo</em> with questions. </p>
<p>“You say he is <em>Siclianu</em>?” <em>Enzo</em> nodded a yes. “Are you sure of it? Did he say it?” </p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>. From <em>Palermu</em>. His name is <em>Conte</em>, as I recall.” <em>Santo</em> leaned to the center of the table and whispered, barely to be heard above the noise in the room. “He is too fair to be a farmer. And look at the suit. He is rich. Maybe railroads.” We took another look, and he caught us looking and smiled, giving a half assed gesture, like a wave, but not a wave. He pointed to the three empty chairs at his table, and we immediately went to him like slaves to the master, without hesitation. Even <em>Luca</em>. We worked our way through a maze of tables placed in no particular order or scheme. As we stumbled past the people, we excused ourselves, while he watched and waved us on, like a beacon in a storm. </p>
<p>“Move your asses…let my friends through,” we hear him say, scolding men at the next table, for being too near him and annoying him. A man scolded <em>Conte</em> for his bad behavior, but luck for him, his friend stepped in and apologized for the disrespectful behavior. <em>Conte</em> did not reply but flicked his head in the direction of the door and without a word of protest or complaint, they left, taking the longer way as not to pass in the front of his table. I see him now, better in the light, and he was a giant, as I figured the night before; a great man, with great hands and a voice to wake the dead, and I wonder how many men he had murdered, or beat severely. And women, too. Men like him a hard on women. I think they like beating women better than beating men. He used his cold stare to threaten; a weapon, like a gun, and I see an animal, cornered, ready to strike. Before we got to his table, a fourth chair appeared and from where it came, I did not see. </p>
<p>“<em>Buonjiorno</em>, my friends,” he said, like a polite and civilized man, who greets guests. </p>
<p>“I am glad you joined me. It was lonely here. I have nothing in common with the rabble in this room.” He looked around and laughed. “I am joking, of course. These are my kind of people…you are my kind of people.” We shook his hand in turn, and I say this with honesty, my hand felt as if it had been squeezed by the jaws of an iron vice. Like the night before, but worse. </p>
<p>Today he was sober. </p>
<p>“Tell me this,” he said to me. “Is it day or night? I am confused by all this iron.” He laughed and pointed to the ceiling. “Up there I think its daylight. Down here is only fit for moles and vermin. No goddamn windows. How do you people live like this?” It was our turn to laugh, and we did, the four of us, as we each stood in front of a chair and waited, hands folded behind our backs, for his permission to sit. <em>Luca</em>, too, but he stood off a way, and did not submit, <em>cento per cento</em>. </p>
<p>“<em>Siediti</em>,” he said, pointing to a chair, introducing himself as <em>Signuri Conte</em>. </p>
<p>He slapped the table, hard. “We can all have a good talk. This will be a long trip.” </p>
<p>A <em>pazzu</em> woman, with three <em>pazzu</em> children, who could not be controlled, complained she was imprisoned by our table, with no way to breathe. A nasty and vile woman, but she had a fair grievance, that we had not acted like gentlemen when we moved our chairs around the table only to please <em>Conte</em>. I tip my cap to her, as any man wearing a cap should do when dealing with a woman, not his wife or other relative. This I can say, with pride, I want to do the right thing, and I believe that every woman is someone’s mother, or will be someday. But <em>Conte</em> was disrespectful, calling her children <em>animali</em>, deserving a hard kick in the ass, that her problem was not the chairs, but she was pissed at her children and cursed the days she gave birth to each of them. And where was her man? I moved my chair, not enough to suit her, though, and she complained all the more. “I am sorry, <em>signora</em>,” I say, as politely as I could, “we are very tight here.” She yelled to her children, “<em>state zitta</em>,” with no authority and they laughed and carried on. She finally left dragging the oldest by this ear, while he complained about the pain, but he deserved no less, as we all agreed. </p>
<p>“A shameless woman,” <em>Conte</em> said. “Where is her man? In <em>Palermu</em> she would not leave home without her husband’s permission and protection.” We agreed, it was not proper for a woman to be alone, considering this boat was mostly men. <em>Luca</em> said he had protected many defenseless women in his time, and we understood what he meant and laughed, <em>Conte</em> laughing the loudest and longest. Before she disappeared from our sight, <em>Conte</em> slapped the table. </p>
<p>“I ask again, what is she doing in a room full of men? She is <em>puttanu</em> (whore) for certain…none of her children look alike…three bastards. <em>Si</em>, three bastards.” We said nothing, not even <em>Luca</em>, who stared at her as she walked away, as she was an attractive woman, but old. Maybe twenty years older than <em>Luca</em>. In the middle of this confusion, with these disrespectful children and the men who would not move, we talked about our own complaints, of cramped rooms, poor food and boredom. <em>Conte</em> complained the air was filthy, then he lit a small, a twisted <em>Sicilian</em> <em>stogie</em>. The smoke swirled around his head and when he looked up, he caught me staring. “<em>Si</em>, cigars bother you. This I recall,” he said, proudly holding the stogie, like it was some reward for sa noble action. </p>
<p>“Are you pissed?” he asked. “I see it in your eyes. I understand. I cannot tolerate other men’s smoke. But my own pleases me.” He asked the table, “Does the smoke bother you gentlemen?” <em>Enzo</em> and <em>Santo</em> both lied, say no, it did not. <em>Luca</em> said nothing. <em>Conte</em> drew in deep and blew smoke across the table. “No one ever seems to mind,” he said, looking direct at me, and smiling. <em>Santo</em> held his breath and turned away, and <em>Enzo</em>, who was telling a story about his time in <em>Roma</em>, was overwhelmed, and wheezed and coughed, and apologized for upsetting the fine conversation. Between gasps for air, he claimed he meant no disrespect to <em>Conte</em> who gave no quarter, calling him a whiner, a complainer, demanding to know why we traveled with a soft and weak man, who would never be a real man if we needed him to be a real man. <em>Enzo</em> was in a panic, of sorts. He addressed <em>Conte</em> direct, who finally came to his own defense. </p>
<p>“Let me say this, <em>signuri Conte</em>. I have skills you may find useful on your way to America,” and he seemed comforted by his own words, and he leaned back in his chair folding both hands on his lap and smiling. </p>
<p>“Such as?” </p>
<p>“Well…and this is only one example, I read and write four languages, fluently. Three dialects of Italian, plus <em>Sicilianu</em>, French and English. Latin, I do not count, and German, of course. As you may know, the ships announcements are written in German and <em>Genovan Italiano</em>. Have you noticed?” <em>Conte</em> gives him a dirty look. </p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, I have. These announcements? You will read them for me?” “Certainly, of course. You only need ask.” </p>
<p>“And will you read me a good night story?” </p>
<p>“Well, uh, I did not mean…ah, our itinerary is posted in every cabin on the ship. Do you know when we are scheduled to dock? The time seems to change…” </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> cold stared <em>Enzo</em>, who was sweating and twisting in his chair. </p>
<p>“I read my own god damned notices,” he yells, and <em>Enzo</em> drops his head. </p>
<p>“You think you are the only fucking man on this ship who reads and writes?” He leaned back and laid his burning cigar on the edge of the table. “I have no fucking need for your assistance, now or tomorrow.” </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> wiped the sweat from his forehead and looked nervously on each face at the table. “I am sorry. I did not mean to imply…well, I thought, perhaps, you had not seen them. That is all I meant…no disrespect.” </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> tapped on the table, making <em>Enzo</em> all the more nervous. </p>
<p>“Teacher,” he calls <em>Enzo</em>, “I am not offended by your need to educate me, but that you are arrogant enough to think I need educating, and that you are the man to do it.” <em>Enzo</em>, his eyes wide, his face frozen, like a brick of ice, said nothing. <em>Niente</em>. “After all, what do you know of me, to think I need your guidance?” </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em>, embarrassed to no end by this ape, cleared his throat just once. He was a nervous little man, as I could see, who answered meekly, like a frightened child or a woman, but not a man, “<em>Signuri</em>, I meant no disrespect, it is just that…” </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> stood, smoothed his jacket and tightened his belt. “You enjoy being with these <em>illiterate’s</em>,” and for some reason unknown to me, he looks straight in my eyes. “You think you free these men from their ignorance. But you are not much of a man, trying to preach good things, like some god dammed priest.” </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> looked for a way of escape. </p>
<p>“<em>Signuri</em>, no. You misunderstand my intentions, I merely…” </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> kept snaping his fingers, looking for the word on the tip of his tongue. “Teacher, uh, your name…I forget your name”. </p>
<p>“<em>Enzo</em>, <em>signuri</em>. <em>Enzo Baneri</em>.” </p>
<p>“Well,” <em>Conte</em> paused. “Your name again?” “<em>Enzo</em>, <em>signuri</em>. <em>Enzo Baneri</em>.” </p>
<p>“Ah, <em>si</em>, ‘<em>Enzo</em>.’ I should write it on my sleeve.” He laughed and grabbed the cuff of his shirt. “You see this cuff?” </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> nods, yes. He did. </p>
<p>“Fine silk, from <em>Milano</em>, worth more than the bale of rags you wear on your back, or carry in your poke, if you have one. But I accept your fool apology, only because I am bored with you. Do not speak of this again.” </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> fell back in his chair, looking peaceful, at ease. <em>Conte</em> raised his hand. </p>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">Recruitment and Final Conflict</h3>

<p>“So, enough bullshit,” he said, with a wave of his hand. “But I have been rude. Introduce me to this fellow here,” he said, looking straight at <em>Luca</em>, who was quiet, eyeing a woman sitting across the room. </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> stood and smoothed his jacket. “Certainly, of course <em>Signuri Conte</em>. May I present <em>Luca</em>...I am sorry…your last name is, uh,” and he went silent. “I am at a loss. <em>Mi dispiace</em>.” </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> stands, stiff, but like a pound man. “<em>Ponto</em>,” he said. <em>Enzo</em> nods. “<em>Panto</em>...yes, this man is <em>Luca Panto</em>.” </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> took <em>Enzo</em> by the arm. “<em>Ponto</em>, not <em>Panto</em>,” he said. </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> checked <em>Luca</em> good, top to bottom, as you would when buying a mule, and I am certain he had no interest in the spelling of his name, “o” or “a,” but the width of his shoulders and strength in the legs and how far he would go to obey. </p>
<p>“You are <em>Luca</em>. <em>Si</em>. <em>Luca Ponto</em>. It is an honor to meet a good <em>Siclianu</em> man.” </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> nodded but said nothing. “And unlike your friend, <em>Enzo</em>, I will remember you are <em>Ponto</em>, not <em>Panto</em>. I will never disrespect your father’s name.” <em>Luca</em> took his hand, that was wider and longer than <em>Luca’s</em>, but maybe not as strong. It was hard to tell. </p>
<p>“<em>Grazie</em>, <em>signuri</em>. I am honored to meet you.” </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> snapped his fingers and motioned with his head, and <em>Enzo</em> changed chairs with <em>Luca</em>, so <em>Luca</em> was next to <em>Conte</em>, who leaned his head back and blew more smoke into the air. He put his hand on <em>Luca’s</em> shoulder, like a friend would do. </p>
<p>“What are your plans in America?” <em>Luca</em> shakes his head. </p>
<p>“Plans? I have no plans. We will live with a cousin, I think. <em>Natale</em>. He promised to get us good paying work on the railroad. He says he is a big shot there.” <em>Conte</em> groaned. </p>
<p>“<em>Mio Diu</em>. The goddamn railroad?” He laughed. “Are you a goddamned mule?” “Well no. I only sweat to eat, <em>signuri</em>. But I would rather be rich, like you.” </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> held up two clenched fists. “Never make fun of sweat,” he said. “I earned what I have with my sweat. America is a big country. Did you know that?” <em>Luca</em> shrugged. </p>
<p>“I suppose it is a big country. That is what they say.” <em>Conte</em> reached and slapped <em>Luca</em> knee. </p>
<p>“You go a mile, then another mile, and when you turn the corner there are more miles and the miles never stop. Not like these shithole towns we come from.” <em>Conte</em> relaxed and tapped on the tabletop. “In your shithole town, you fall asleep and when you wake up in a hundred years, it is the same shithole town, and what has changed? Nothing has changed, but the men you once worked with are dead, and their grandchildren are aimless in the street. Nowhere to go. Nothing to do. Like a road that ends at the edge of a cliff. You jump or hang yourself.” <em>Luca</em> nodded. He agreed, more to be polite, I believe. </p>
<p>“We are going someplace; <em>Siracusa</em>, I think. I am not sure where it is.” </p>
<p>“It is in the province of New York,” <em>Conte</em> said. “I have been there. The winters are not <em>Sicilian</em> winters, where winter is a little chilly rain. In America, you will see ten feet of snow, or more. Ice a foot thick.” </p>
<p>Ten feet of snow? How can this be? Everyone would drown in the snow. <em>Impossibile</em>. </p>
<p>“You are like children,” <em>Conte</em> said. He leaned so close to <em>Luca</em> they were almost eye to eye. Both tough looking men, but <em>Conte</em> was wider in the shoulders, and taller. Fierce. </p>
<p>“You will freeze your ass to the bone.” he smiled, and I see his crooked teeth. Bad teeth. </p>
<p>Ten feet of snow, <em>mio Diu</em>. I have not seen more than an inch, maybe two. A little snow on the hills, at night, but gone in an hour, maybe two. Sometimes we do not see snow for years. Who said ten feet of snow? I hate the goddamned cold. And snow? I see no purpose for it. </p>
<p>“You remember him? The old clerk for the comune. A good man. He was going strong at ninety, because he never worked a day in the cold or the rain. Remember his wife, <em>Maria Andreolli</em>, she was thirty years younger, and built. He died with a pencil in his hand and a smile on his face.” </p>
<p>I laughed with the rest; even <em>Conte</em> laughed. I did not recall <em>Mastelli</em> in the same way, but a mean man, hated by the whole village, except his <em>parenti</em> (relatives). He never worked a day in the cold or the rain, because his brother was a landowner and bought him the job, for ten <em>lire</em>, we heard. It is good to have a rich brother. Me? My brother <em>Paolo</em> never gave me a job. The best he did (and I love him for it) he gave me a pair of boots (old, with no laces) a month before the army took me away. The boots were near junk, thrown on the garbage heap at <em>Colangeli’s</em> farm heap by his son. <em>Paolo</em> saw them and took them and hid them in the weeds until night. <em>Colangeli</em> caught him. “They are not garbage,” he said. “But you can work off the cost.” A month’s labor my brother paid for a shit pair of boots. They fit good, but I needed laces, leather laces. I tell <em>Paolo</em>, God love him, and the next day he snuck into <em>Colangeli’s</em> barn and walked out with a pair of new, leather laces. Th e heavy ones. God love him. </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> fished in his pocket for another cigar, while the first still burned on the tables edge, charring the wood. </p>
<p>“You people.” He laughed. “You inherit your father’s eyes, his view of the world, and nothing else. This is what your life will be. Because of him you will freeze your balls in the winter, and in the summer, you will dig ditches and lay rail, and your balls will freeze in the cold and thaw and shrivel like dried grapes in the sun. Not one <em>coglioni</em>, but two and if you have no sons now, you will never have sons and spend the rest of your life shoveling shit and doing the work the <em>americani</em> will not do.” He knocked the first cigar to the floor and crushed it. “In the winter, the snow covers the tracks, up to your ass,” he said, making the motions of a man shoveling snow. “And the old man next to you will sooner or later croak from it, and then it will be your turn, and who will remember your name. The snow will melt, then freeze in the crack of your ass.” He brushed the sleeves of is jacket, taking a deep drag on the freshly lit <em>stogie</em>, and he coughed and complained they were <em>stogies</em> from <em>Napoli</em>, not <em>Palermu</em>, and smoked like a good length of dried shit. </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> cleared his throat. </p>
<p>My compliments, <em>signuri</em>. You talk like a man of the world,” and at this <em>Conte</em> nodded and smiled, but his smile faded to a cold stare, as if his mind wandered to sometime in the past. </p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>. I worked the railroads in <em>Chicago</em>.” He held up two fingers. “Two years. <em>Steamroads</em> they are called.” </p>
<p>“Why did you leave?” <em>Luca</em> asked. “The work was not to your liking?” </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> leaned back and loosened his collar and sighed. He smiled like a cat would smile. “They said I wore out my welcome…like a bad relative. They made a fool out of me, but I swear to have the last laugh,” and he laughed at the moment, but I was afraid to laugh with him, as he might see it as disrespectful, that maybe I was laughing at him. “I went there…like the four of you, with a dream of fortune and coming home with a pocketful of cash, like a fucking king. </p>
<p>Maybe buy land, be my own boss. What is better?” </p>
<p>What is so different about this man, I wondered? He is a bullshitter, like most men who are bosses, or want to be bosses. He is a brute, like no man I have known, and I believe he scares <em>Luca</em>, who has never been afraid of another man. </p>
<p>“I worked the farm when I was a boy,” he said, with little emotion. “Like all of you have done. But not this man, here,” he points to <em>Enzo</em>, who was embarrassed by the light shining on him, and he twisted and turned, squirming in his chair. I was sorry for him. </p>
<p>“One day, thank God, I seemed grew up overnight and became a man. It was <em>Agosto</em>, I recall, the day so hot the rocks cracked from the heat. I was working with my cousin, <em>Enrico</em>, who is dead now, God rest his soul,” and <em>Conte</em> makes the sign of the cross, that was not sincere, but for show. “We were thirsty, and my cousin walked a mile to haul water from the stream, but the boss grabbed the pail and pointed to the mules, who were tethered under an oak tree. </p>
<p>“‘The mules drink first, goddamn it,’” says this bastard. ‘They work harder than you do. And for no pay.’” <em>Conte</em> leans into the table, pointing a finger at each of us in turn. “To this <em>cavone</em>, we were worth less than a fucking pile of bones. I was born that day, my friends. Born a full-grown man, and I am still a man.” </p>
<p>“Who has not felt that way?” I say, but he scoffed. </p>
<p>“But do you know why?” He paused. “Worth…It is about worth…nothing else.” “Worth? <em>Non capisco</em>,” I said. “What has this to do with being thirsty?” </p>
<p>He rests his elbows on the table, as if praying, but I believed he was a heathen. He grabbed his ear and pulled, like the old <em>Sicilians</em> would do. </p>
<p>“<em>Ascolti</em>,” he screams, slapping the tabletop. “Listen and learn from me.” He searched his pockets for something. A cigar, I figured. “If the fucking mule drops dead, the owner must buy another, out of his own pocket. But if one of the <em>contadini</em> drops dead, a hundred fight to take his place, and maybe working for less pay, if he is desperate. Desperate is good if you are the boss. Maybe his children starve, and he will work for what he can get, or steal, and face prison. The boss will profit from your death if men fight for your job. The mule has more value, because the <em>capu</em> must buy it.” He paused. “What do you think?” </p>
<p>No one answered, not even <em>Enzo</em>, who chose to stare at the wall. </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> was angry, steaming; he slapped the table again and cleaned it off with one sweep of his hand. </p>
<p>“Fuck all of you. More of you should all die. Any <em>cavone</em> can shake an olive tree. Your death is nothing more than an inconvenience for men like me.” </p>
<p>“The boss cannot be beat,” <em>Santo</em> said. “My father said this many times.” “But we are doing it,” I say. “We are leaving. What will they do?” </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> laughs. “America? This is your answer? You think they will treat you like a man? Is that what you think? Maybe you beat the boss in <em>Sicilia</em>, maybe, but where you are going there are more bosses than grains of sand in a handful. A thousand times more. <em>Wops</em>. <em>Dago’s</em>. This is what we are.” He had no humor, as I could tell, or did he seem to enjoy humor, but he laughed a lot, but only at other men’s trouble. </p>
<p>He clenched both fists </p>
<p>“Take your life in your own two hands. If the rules are not your rules…then fuck the rules.” He clenched harder; his fists turned white, and his face twisted, as if he was in pain. </p>
<p>“Take your life in your two hands. It is the only way we survive. If that is important to you.” He quieted down and put both hands on his knees like a gentle man would do. We had listened to his rant, like children standing before an angry father, and said nothing while he gave us his view of life, and <em>Luca</em> said nothing, but I think he must have been thinking ‘what does this madman want with me.’ I know him. I do not know what makes a watch tick, but I know what makes <em>Luca</em> tick. <em>Conte</em> was quiet and calm, but for less than a minute, then he erupts. </p>
<p>“Fuck them all. This is how you survive like a man. Nothing more is needed.” He wiped the sweat from his face and forehead, and he relaxed. </p>
<p>“Are you an <em>anarchist</em>?” <em>Enzo</em> asked, but no answer. “It is not that I am opposed to <em>anarchy</em> as a principle, you understand. But history has taught us…” <em>Conte’s</em> massive right hand cut through the air and slammed onto the tabletop, and I believed he cracked it. </p>
<p>“Enough bullshit,” he said, loud and clear, so heads turned. Peculiar. I had not heard talk like this before, though I took no part in it. <em>Conte</em>, who might have been embarrassed, fixes his jacket in front of all eyes, smiled and nodded, then apologized. </p>
<p>“<em>Scusa</em>,” he said to all who heard his rant, then he sat and put himself together, and no one at the table spoke for a good five minutes. During the silence, I played with my shirt sleeve, and <em>Enzo</em> tapped the tabletop, while <em>Santo</em> did nothing; <em>Luca</em> eyed the few women in the room. </p>
<p>Finally, <em>Conte</em> spoke, and he was calmed, but I waited for another explosion, like a boiler under too much pressure. He points at <em>Enzo</em>, an inch from his face, and <em>Enzo</em> did not move a muscle, or twitch, but he could not look away. </p>
<p>“What do I care about this shit you speak of. This <em>anarchy</em>, that <em>anarchy</em>. Profit, teacher. I only think of profit. Any profit, any amount, from anywhere I find it, and I promise you, I will do anything to get it.” He paused. “Anything.” He leaned back and checked the room, no jokes. no smiling, no laughing. “I have known men like you. Talk. Talk. Talk. You never do anything but talk. And you talk about the rules. I believe in rules. <em>Si</em>. Of course. A lot of rules, but my rules, and the most important rule is the rule of survival. Do what you must to survive. And think of this…if you obey the rules and do not survive…then what was your purpose?” </p>
<p>We had no worth by what <em>Conte</em> says. An old mule has more value, but I have heard this before, and my father said it, not about me, but all the <em>contadini</em>. I sat with my hands folded in my lap, like a woman would do and I felt helpless like women say they always feel. When <em>Enzo</em> said “<em>anarchist</em>,” I wondered the meaning of it and asked <em>Enzo</em>, who explained it was a man who saw law and rules as evil. Who is not an <em>anarchist</em>? I have always known, learned at my father’s knee, that law is for the rich, and the rich will use it as a club to keep us down and poor, and the politicians are corrupt, and the Church is corrupt, and the wealthy are corrupt. I have heard it all before. Now we run from it and not into it, as is always possible. If they ask, I will say I am no <em>anarchist</em>, else they will probably throw my ass into the sea. Goddamn. I just want to eat good, not all the time, some of the time, and live in peace. </p>
<p><em>Santo</em>, the churchman, the good Catholic, who loves his mama and the Italian flag. His face was white and he sat alone, as if he was alone in the world. He cleared his throat. </p>
<p>“What are you saying? We are all honest men here. Do you say…” <em>Conte</em> listened to a few words, and I see the disgust on his face. He pushed the table away, quietly, and he drew no special attention. </p>
<p>“I will tell you what I am saying, A man stays honest by taking what he needs…for himself, his family. Fuck the rest. If he is desperate, maybe starving, and his children are starving, then he will kill to eat. If he robs along the way, then he is not hungry and never will become desperate. This is the real law.” His eyes lifted to the ceiling. “God’s law, if it makes you feel better. The only law that counts.” <em>Santo</em> cleared his throat. </p>
<p>“Then I am only honest if I steal?” </p>
<p>“Correct. Only if you steal are you an honest man, but to yourself and your family…that is all that is important.” I hear a great sigh from <em>Enzo</em>. </p>
<p>“You have a cruel view of life, <em>signuri</em>.” </p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, cruel. But not as cruel as life. Only the strong survive, or everyone would be weak; this is nature’s way and the right way, or the best will lose to the greater number of weaklings. And I want no weakling around me, as he will bring me down to save his worthless ass.” Sometime during this conversation, I cannot say when, three men took the table abandoned by the crazy women, and each lit a cigar and the smoke followed a current of air that covered our table, like smoke from a wildfire. Behind us, in the corner, a woman leaned over a child who coughed so hard, I believed he would throw up on the table. The smoke and the filthy air had bested the young boy and his face was red from the hacking, and his mother kept slapping his back, as he coughed up green. </p>
<p>“All I want is a few <em>lire</em> to buy land,” <em>Santo</em> said. “A small farm for me and my wife.” </p>
<p>Why all this talk about survival? A few <em>lire</em>, maybe a hundred. This is all I want or need.” <em>Conte</em> laughed. </p>
<p>“A few <em>lire</em>? Nothing but shit money. And what about survival? If you do not understand it, then you have no chance of living like a man…that’s all…no chance.” </p>
<p>“I do not like the way you think, <em>signuri</em>. I believe…” </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> pounced like a cat, grabbing <em>Santo’s</em> arm, and the look on his face was pure fear, as if he saw the end of his life. I pushed from the table and stood up, not that I was going to my friends’ defense, but <em>Conte</em> released his grip and slapped the table and <em>Santo</em> jumped back, startled. <em>Conte</em> laughed. </p>
<p>“What’s the matter. Seen a ghost?” and he was surprised no one laughed with him. He laughed too much, as I said, mostly at other men’s trouble. I did not like him, but I worked hard not to show it, as he scared hell out of me. I look at <em>Enzo</em>, who was too quiet for an educated man and he seemed out of place. </p>
<p>“What do you say to this?” I ask him. </p>
<p>“I am only a poor teacher,” he said, but with honesty and humility, I believe. </p>
<p>“I teach men to read and write, to think, and maybe help them learn something about life. But this,” he shrugged his shoulders. “I do not know what to think of this. I have heard it all before, but not said as powerfully.” He looks at <em>Conte</em>, “you are a forceful man,” he said. </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> finally spoke. “Not me,” he said, shaking a clenched fist. He looked at <em>Conte</em> and nodded. “I believe this man is right. All that counts is what you have. Not how you get it.” </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> applauded <em>Luca</em>. “Well said, for a dirt farmer, and maybe I will change that.” </p>
<p><em>Luca</em>, I knew him like the back of my hand, as <em>papa</em> says. Yesterday he admired the priest, today, his hero is a thief and maybe more. Who presents the loudest argument, or makes the last argument, wins in <em>Luca’s</em> mind? <em>Conte</em> was, no doubt, some <em>brigand</em>, like <em>Enzo</em> says. But who is <em>Enzo</em>? Who he is I cannot say? He is new to me, an unknown thing and for his education and travel, the languages he speaks, he is a strange man from somewhere else. I expected he would quote some wisdom, from a book he read, challenging <em>Signuri Conte’s</em> view of life. He did not, and in the end, he was mostly silent. <em>Santo</em> does not count at these times; he is just here. This criminal <em>Conte</em> and <em>Luca</em>, together, won the day, I now believe. </p>
<p>The putrid cigar smoke was thick, like a winter fog; my eyes dripped onto the table. I hated cigar smoke; most of all, I hated cigar smokers, but I have said this before. I could hardly breathe, but I refused to complain about bad lungs and will not do it again. </p>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Offer and the Split</h3>

<p><em>Conte</em> touched <em>Luca’s</em> shoulder. </p>
<p>“I believe you are a man who understands the world as it is.” Fatigue showed on <em>Conte’s</em> face, and he lay back in his chair, nervously tapping on his right leg as his left leg trembled. He points to <em>Luca</em>, “tell your friends to leave…go ahead, do it.” <em>Luca</em> did not move a muscle. I turned away and looked to the back of the room, as if I had not heard <em>Conte’s</em> order. <em>Santo</em> cleared his throat, then asked <em>Enzo</em> if he knew the correct time. <em>Conte</em> repeated his order. </p>
<p>“Go ahead. Tell your friends to leave, they will understand. We have business.” “I cannot tell them to leave. They…” </p>
<p><em>Conte</em> stood up, and his chair tipped into the next table; he seemed embarrassed by his lack of control. “Leave,” he said, his voice harsh and strict. He pointed to the open doorway. We heard his order, but no one moved. Was it a joke? His face was red. He shouts the order again, so angry he stuttered, and now I see the spit flying out of his mouth. </p>
<p><em>Luca</em> said it again, “I cannot ask my friends to leave. They are…” </p>
<p>“Nonsense, they will understand.” <em>Conte</em> leaned into the table, resting on his bear claw hands. He looked directly at me, and in a commanding voice he said, “I have business with this man. Leave. All of you.” He pointed to the door and <em>Enzo</em> jumps to his feet, with a groan, and I followed, and <em>Santo</em> followed me. </p>
<p>“Of course, <em>signori</em>, business,” I said. “We understand.” </p>
<p>He was a man to be respected and feared, but in what order I could not tell until I thought more on it, as I realized that in <em>Sicilia</em>, to some men, respect and fear are the same thing. We left and gathered in the corridor. Not outcasts, though he ordered us to leave, more the lucky ones, as <em>Luca</em> was left alone with this madman. </p>
<p><em>Santo</em> offered wisdom for the moment. </p>
<p>“<em>Luca</em> can take care of himself. He can hold his own with any man, any time,.” </p>
<p>But the truth, what could we do for him, except pray, and we left that to <em>Santo</em>. I pray, sometimes, for a special thing, but not like <em>Santo</em>, who prays for enjoyment because it makes him feel good; nothing has every come of it for him, but feeling good is good enough, he says. We had nothing to do, so we wander the corridors, like vagrants, searching for someplace new, but there was nothing but the same. After a while and three right turns and two left turns, we were at an isolated place, near the engine room (we figure this by the noise and the smell of fuel). </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> leaned against the wall; his arms folded. </p>
<p>“He is a criminal…you know he is a criminal, maybe worse.” </p>
<p><em>Santo</em> pulls up his collar, over his nose, to block the smell of burning fuel, that was thick in the air. “Who is a criminal? Who are you speaking of?” </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> laughed. “Who are we talking about? <em>Conte</em>…you heard him. Right now, he is recruiting <em>Luca</em> to join his army.” <em>Enzo</em> rested against the iron wall; the fingers of his right hand tapping on his chest. I see more tapping that day than I saw the rest of my life. </p>
<p>Two young men walked at us. </p>
<p>“<em>Bongiornu</em>,” they say as they passed, but I ignore them, in no mood to mix with men I did not know. </p>
<p>I thought of <em>Luca</em>, a prisoner in a cage, no bars, no locks, but no way out. I blame this on <em>Enzo</em>. <em>Luca</em> has an empty head, I know, and <em>Conte</em> will fill it with grand stories of money and respect and power, but in the end, <em>Luca</em> will be dead or living in some filthy American prison. I thought, maybe it is not all that bad. Sometimes <em>Luca</em> has good sense, and I was sure he was no thief, or did he ever murder a human, or beat another man who did not deserve it. I put my hand on <em>Enzo’s</em> shoulder, but never asked him the question I should have asked. </p>
<p>“<em>Luca</em> is a big talker,” I say to <em>Enzo</em>. “A big mouth, but he is a sensible man.” </p>
<p>“A violent man. You said it yourself.” </p>
<p>“You are right. He is a fighter, but no murderer.” </p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> was shaking against the wall, sweating and I bet he shit his pants, at least some. “Will he come after me? I am just an old man with a big mouth.” </p>
<p>I lied like the devil would lie. </p>
<p>“Do not concern yourself. <em>Luca</em> is not that kind of man.” I said it to his face, for no reason but that he deserved a lie. Maybe <em>Luca</em> will thank <em>Enzo</em>, buy him a decent glass of <em>grappa</em>, or if all did not go well, beat him mercilessly, even if he is an old man. <em>Luca</em> lives to fight. He was eighteen, maybe nineteen; I see him take on two men at the same time, both older and by their look, stronger and tougher. <em>Nunzio Culotti</em> and his cousin <em>Giovanni Culotti</em>. Both stone masons, arms like trunks and hard, nasty drinkers. They say <em>Nunzio</em>, but not <em>Giovanni</em>, could split a rock the size of a good man’s head with one blow of his stone hammer. Both were drunk one day, when they cornered <em>Luca’s</em> sister, <em>Catia</em>, as she came out of the orchards, behind the <em>Chiesa Di Sant’Agatha</em>. They fondled her, she said, but I believe they did more, but this she would not admit. She tells <em>Luca</em>, who did nothing and decided he would wait for the right time. </p>
<p>A few days later he catches the two men together, both sober. They apologize for their behavior (they knew <em>Luca</em>) but he refused their apology and <em>Nunzio</em> threw the first punch, I believe to get the advantage. <em>Luca</em> fought crazy, like a rabid dog; first, one at a time, then together. He beat them bad and bloody; one volley from a good-sized rock he picked up on the roadside. In the end, they lay moaning on the wet cobblestone, and the whole town heard <em>Nunzio</em> whimper, as his cousin pleaded for mercy, that they both had enough.
