    <h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px; font-style: italic;">Leaving the Mountain</h1>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Last Embrace</h3>
    <p>The night before I leave for America, did I sleep? No. I stumble to the outhouse every ten minutes, because I refuse to use the pot. The rut I cut in the ground to the back of the house, looked, maybe, to be an inch deeper. My gut ached all night, and a good shit made no difference. I ailed most of the week; food made me sick, and the thought of it called up hot juice in my gullet, and I admit, after a week my chest and mouth ached.</p>
    <p>The day finally came.</p>
    <p>I have not been down the mountain for two years, since the army, and two years before that when they come for all the men old enough to be taken, that was pretty much any man who could breathe. I recall the officer in charge, a small man, pocked face; he had my name, and the names of three other men, in a book he held tight in his right hand. He walks to the clerk’s office, near double time, like his ass was on fire, followed close by ten, or twenty young boys, who did not have to go because they were too young, and they could laugh and find it exciting. He presents the book to the clerk, the brother of the mayor, and demands help in rounding us up.</p>
    <p>“These men are ready for service,” he said, waving this little book in the air, to a crowd that gathered to hear the fate of their sons. “They will proudly serve the Kingdom,” he said and <em>Andrea Pozzo</em> spits on the ground. I see smiles from the other men, happy it was not their sons, or themselves, as they were too old, or had done their time, but some women cried, and there was no violence, or shout of disrespect. I was angry. What could I do?</p>
    <p>“I am Siclianu,” I tell the officer. “Not Italiano. Who are you to take me away?”</p>
    <p>He listened to me and the others who complained, but in the end, he yawned and ordered us to form along the imaginary line he cast with a wave of his hand.</p>
    <p>“<em>Qui</em>,” he said, pointing to a spot in front of where he stood.</p>
    <p>“Be quick about it,” he said, and the men in the crowd nodded. He had the law behind him, the guns and the power, so I went, but kicking and screaming. <em>Rosario Ponto</em>, a cousin from my mother’s side, swears my only show of revolt was dust I kicked up when I scuffed my boot on the ground, in protest, and maybe some cursing under my breath.</p>
    <p>“You went like a lamb,” was his recollection. “This protest was all in your mind.” Not true. I am certain I cursed direct at one of the officers. Maybe not, it was a long time ago.</p>
    <p>Rosario had a good memory, so maybe he is correct, but what does it matter? We never got along, so it is reasonable he would put me down; He never served. Bad back. Gored by a bull. The lucky sonofabitch. That was yesterday.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Today, I leave home like a man, no rifle barrel in my back, but the Kings chattel. Why, men ask, do you leave the place where you were born?</p>
    <p><strong>Senza denaro</strong>. I am broke.</p>
    <p><strong>Sono affamato</strong>. I am hungry.</p>
    <p><strong>Sono impotenti</strong>. I have no power.</p>
    <p>Are there better reasons? I own nothing but the callouses on my hands, and they always bleed, and the back of a sixty-year-old man; proof to anyone I am a good worker. I leave at the worst time, I know this, and they say it to my face, many times. Mama and papa, they are old and sick; they need me. I should stay, but I cannot. Guilt? <em>Si</em>, I have guilt. It is a thing that can be possessed and owned, and in that I am a rich man. But hear this: If there was work, I would stay, even for everything else. But there is no work, or if there is work, with the wages they pay, if they pay at all, we fall deeper into a hole that has no bottom.</p>
    <p>No bottom? Is it possible to go deeper than the bottom of a hole?</p>
    <p>The Sparacino’s have never owned land, or is there a friend who has ever owned land, because all of it, every rock and stone, is owned by a few; the wealthy men and the <em>capu’s</em>, and this is a plan. A great, brilliant plan for the few. There is no rain, so there is no mud and that is good, but we have no food because there is no rain, and this is famine. The water is not so good, but we drink it, when thirsty animals turn away from a pail of it and die of thirst. We are always sick; there are no doctors or medicine. Papa liked to say, when you look up, all you see is the bottom of the <em>capu’s</em> boot. And there is the god damned government men. What there is to eat, they take it and eat it and leave us the crumbs, but we pay tax on the whole piece. What there is to steal, they steal unless the bandits want it, and then they fight the bandits for the right to steal it. If you speak out in the <em>piazza</em>, your teeth are knocked out with the butt end of a rifle. The priests only want work in the cities, where the better (the richer) <em>I cattolico</em> live. So, I ask this, what is the reason to get up in the morning, except to leave?</p>
    <p>This is the <em>capu’s</em> land, my family worked for a hundred years when there is work; a nasty and vengeful man, greedier, fouler every day, because he is old and close to death. I know it. I see it. He must know it, but is it my fault? The wealthy are born to their wealth, as it passes from father to son, with the family name. The <em>briganti</em>, the bandits, steal whatever they have, and live by one rule, that to feel another man’s pain is bad for business. Whoever the father beat, the son will beat, and whoever the father has stolen from, the son will steal from. My father apologized and wept, that he has nothing to give us when he passes. So, I will go to America to earn money to buy land, maybe only an acre, and we will work it ourselves. I say I will return, and when I say it I mean it, but sometimes I do not.</p>
    <p>It is tradition to die in the place where you are born. I have been a soldier; I have seen the world and to die here so family says what good man you were, makes no sense to me. Let them sing on the feast days, and praise tradition, and weep when they sift the soil through their fingers. I and tired of working their fields and paying their taxes, their tribute, and they deny me a small piece of what they enjoy from my sweat. I spent two years in the goddamned army, when an officer hands me a few <em>lire</em>, two, I think; says “<em>grazie</em>,”(but all I did was shovel horsesit and guard air), and tells me I must leave, go home. “If you leave now,” he says, “you will make it easy in a day, or two, or maybe a week, if the <em>briganti</em> do not get you first (leave your rifle). We taught you to shoot and defend yourself, and it is a shame you will have no gun. <em>Buona fortuna</em>.”</p>
    <p>When I walk through the <em>Piazza</em> on the day I got home, what did I see, idle bodies warming the benches in the middle of the day, not a smile or sign of purpose on any man’s face. My town aged a hundred years in two years. More poverty, more disease, more land owned by the rich men, or gone to waste. The bosses, the government men and their <em>briganti</em>, grind away at what spirit is left, and the earth is red under our feet.</p>
    <p>I am the oldest son of <em>Orazio Sparacino</em> and <em>Giovanna Rizzo</em>. They have not left the mountain in years. “Why,” they say. “Everything we need is here.”</p>
    <p>When I say I am leaving, mama cries. Papa is angry. Life is pain wherever you are, mama says, and papa nods to agree, but he says different when she is not around. When I say we should all leave, papa laughs. “We are old. Soon we will be part of the dirt, like the rocks.” They are tied here, forever, they will never break away.</p>
    <p>My grandmothers, my grandfathers, they are still alive, except mama’s mother, who died years ago. She was a young woman when she passed, but unhappy, they say; moody, not fit, not able to accept the harshness of this life. “She had devils,” mama said, making the sign of the cross. Disease wore her to nothing, but I have memories of her, like a figure in a dream, always with the same apron, made from fine cloth, clean and white, an orange flower sewn to the corner, a wedding gift from her mother. Once a day she filled the apron with scraps and walked to <em>Via Roma</em>, where she tended three pigs for the <em>capu</em>, and she scattered the food and laughed while these filthy animals squealed and fought for their piece. Mama said of her mother, “she was a stern woman, who yelled and made me cry.” My mother’s father is still alive, living with his oldest daughter, <em>zia Sophia</em>, far away, in <em>Marcella</em>, a greater village across the hills. We never see him; maybe at the <em>Festa di Sant’Agatha</em>, that’s all. It is a day’s walk, each way to <em>Marcella</em>. I will not visit him before I leave; all he would say is that I am a fool for wasting my time.</p>
    <p><em>Agatha</em> is my oldest sister; dead, by the will of God, <em>Patri</em> says. She was six days old.</p>
    <p>Mama cried all night, and screamed and questioned the goodness of God, but later she asked His forgiveness. If you have four children, even three, one will certainly die young, maybe two. The <em>Carlucci’s</em> lost four of their five children, before their mother, drown in the stream on Castello’s farm. Some say she killed to relieve her pain.</p>
    <p>“The will of God,” <em>Patri</em> said, as he made the sign of the cross.</p>
    <p>My sister Agatha was named for my mother’s mother. It is good for me, in a way, that she died before I was born, as to have known her and lost her would have been too painful. Am I a selfish to think this way? In five years, another sister was born, and by the grace of God she is fit and healthy, also called Agatha, out of respect for the soul of our dead sister. My brother, Paolo, is a few years younger than me, there is Salvatore, the youngest and Maria.</p>
    <p>We live in one of Castello’s shacks; only one room cut into three rooms, no more than a stable at the end of <em>Via Golia</em>, with a dirt floor, a roof that leaks, unless the rain come from the south and then it is a gift from God. No leaks. No leaks, no mud. We are the last shack on a street of shacks, so we have an extra wall to the weather. The icy mountain wind is the curse of winter, that blows through cracks in the stone, though papa packs them with mud and straw, at least three times a year. In the spring, if there is no drought, the streets flood with runoff from the hills, and the wells are corrupted and diseased. April to September are the mean times of summer, when we suffer through brutal heat and vermin. Mama leaves the door open, day and night, to catch any breeze that will move air inside the house. Animals are in and out, chickens and goats mostly, but sometimes a dog or a cat, that are wild and live in the streets, and when they die of starvation, the carcass is picked clean by rats that come from the hills at night. Mama told <em>Signuri Pezza</em>, she will kill his goat the next time it is loose and runs through the house, upsetting the chairs, causing her grief and distress. Her house, her kingdom and she is queen.</p>
    <p>Castello is a little man, vile of spirit, with no teeth, but two on the bottom, most rotted to the gum; a greedy man, with no humanity and we work for him and rent from him, and he squeezes papas <em>culiones</em>, only for the joy of hearing him scream. Our body and soul he owns, and to anger him is like death, to be out of work and homeless. With his land, his possessions, he has power, so he is feared and from fear he has respect. What is wrong with us, that we respect a man who holds this power? Sometimes, when there is a little work, and no disease and no mud and the crops grow, I say to myself, “is this so bad?”</p>

    <hr>

    <p><em>Paolo Bello</em> said he would go with me to America, and for this I was excited, as he is nearly an educated man, who signs his name and reads a little <em>Sicilianu</em>, he learned from his uncle when the family lived in <em>Albitiri</em>. But he is a man, like me, with no future in the country of his birth. We go to the passport office, to make an inquiry and nothing else. The <em>cavone</em> in charge was sitting on his ass behind a desk and treated us with contempt. A <em>pezzonovante</em>, for certain; his brother a great and distinguished landowner in the province. Big shot. He knows, his brother knows, they both know, if the <em>contadini</em> leave, who will pick the crops, if the crops grow again (we were in a drought and the earth cracked open).</p>
    <p>“Why go to America?” this <em>cavone</em> says to Paolo Bello, who was shaking in his boots (the left boot had no sole). He puts his arm around Paolo’s neck and squeezes, in fun, he said.</p>
    <p>“Go to America? Why do such a foolish thing?”</p>
    <p>He stared over the top of his eyeglasses, gold rims, from <em>Roma</em>, they say. “Life is good here, in the town where you were born. You have land to farm, and goats give you free milk. Everything you need…but you must work hard…you are not afraid of hard work, are you?”</p>
    <p>This bastard of a sonofabitch. Is his god damn back worn out, like mine? Does he scream in pain when he bends to tie his boot? Or his goddamned knees? Do they talk when he walks, or give way, and he falls like some crippled bastard? Life is good for him, this <em>cavone</em>, who has lost his soul, or never had a soul, who moves papers all day long.</p>
    <p>“Of course,” he says, “You are entitled to a passport, it is the law. But think it over. I hear the <em>Carabinieri</em> have stopped the boats leaving <em>Sicilia</em>. This is what I hear.”</p>
    <p>Bello, my partner, the near educated man, said nothing, not a word, or a cough or a grunt.</p>
    <p>In the end, he backed out and married <em>Giovanna Martuffi</em>, a virginal young woman, they say, from <em>Itala</em>. No beauty, if beauty is important; but with her hand (like a man’s hand, <em>grande</em>, with hairy knuckles) come three acres of land, four head of good cattle and five pieces of farm equipment, only two in bad need of repair. Bello waited three years to collect what had been promised to him. His father-in-law took to his deathbed, but he lingered thanks to the masses said for him and all the candles his family lit in honor of <em>Sant’Agatha</em>. His wife was a disagreeable woman, difficult to live with from the first day, and sadly, her teeth went bad, rotting mostly away, and now she looks like Castello’s oldest sister, who was like sin. As I see it, land is land, and my friend believed he made a good deal for himself. And <em>si</em>, yes, <em>Paolo Bello</em> stiffed me, but I have partnered with two men, both dependable in their own way. Luca and Santo. Everything is planned, each minute considered. We will go down the mountain (the side, not the winding road, to save time and escape the <em>briganti</em> who wait on the roads for defenseless travelers); take the train to <em>Messina</em>; the ferry across the <em>Stretto</em>; another train to <em>Napoli</em>, from <em>Villa San Giovanni</em>, and our steamer to America. Sixteen days, at most, was my estimate, counting the sea trip, if the Goddamn boat does not sink, as it most likely will. We bought tickets on the <em>Antonio Lopez</em>, from two drummers who brought a battered and broken mule, loaded with dry goods, up the mountain road. Sundries was their usual business; steamship tickets to America was only a service, they said, and the company paid them almost nothing for their trouble.</p>
    <p>Brokers, they called themselves, seeming proud of this title. Brokers. I have not known a broker before. Like always they spread their wares cross the <em>piazza</em>, hawking knives and salt and flour, while drinking wine and smoking cigars, as they eyed every woman who stopped to look, or passed by. When I asked on the price of the tickets, the old one laughed. “How much will you pay?” he said with his <em>Calabrese</em> sarcasm. But sarcasm did not set well with Luca, who grabbed this <em>cavone</em> by the collar, swearing to toss him and his partner and his mule, off the mountain. In the army they say Luca killed a man in a knife fight, over some loose woman. I never asked. Was it any of my business? The broker struggled to break from Luca’s grip, that was always like an iron vice.</p>
    <p>Luca leers at this <em>cavone</em>. “Your next answer will be civilized and respectful,” he said, as the sonofabitchs legs shook like the leaves on a tree, in a good mountain wind. The poor bastard was beat, he had no more fancy talk, just stuttering and spitting and tears.</p>
    <p>“For my friends I have this deal,” he said, as he struggled to pull free from Luca’s grip. “Twenty-five <em>lire</em> a piece. Half price,” he said, “just do not hurt me.” Luca smiled, released his grip and the poor bastard fell to the wet cobblestones. We picked our date, a few months in the future, <em>marzo</em>; paid the money, him his money, took the papers and left, satisfied we made a good deal. The hawkers whined and complained, they came up the mountain to this god forsaken place for a few miserable tickets, and a pound of flour and Luca.</p>
    <p>The <em>Antonio Lopez</em>. <em>Sabato</em> (Saturday). <em>Marzo 10</em> (March 10). <em>Mezzanotte</em> (Midnight). Two months, to the day, from the day we meet the peddlers and bought their tickets. We hear more rumors, from the men everybody believes, the important men, or the kin, or friends of important men; this time from <em>Antonio Fiumara</em>, who was told by his brother in <em>Palermu</em> (a government man) that the <em>Carabinieri</em> will stop the <em>contadini</em> from leaving <em>Sicilia</em> until the harvest is in. I said he was wrong, and they laughed at me, men I have known all my life. I was not a boss, or an owner, or a <em>pezzonovante</em>, who are always heard, even when they speak in a whisper. They have all the land, all the guns and all the cops. If the cops choose to stop us, what can we do? We are at war with ourselves, and we are losing. Tomorrow morning, before dawn, I will stand in line with fifty other men, and pray and listen; only ten men will be called, if any are called, and the ten will do their work and the work of the forty men who were sent home. The <em>capu</em> will glare at the forty. “Come back tomorrow,” he says. “Maybe I will be in a better mood, if my wife is good to me,” and he laughs, and his overseer laughs and the ten he hired laugh before they are sent off to the fields. We will come back the next day and wait, like statues, and maybe the <em>capu</em> will not show. Maybe he is in <em>Palermu</em> to rest, so his overseer picks men for the day. He picks his men and tells the rest, “Go home, <em>Mi dispiaci</em>, I am so sorry. Try again tomorrow.” When the crops are bad, do they blame God or the weather? No. They blame us. “If only you worked a little harder, a little faster. You peasants are lazy and spoiled, thinking only of getting drunk and violating decent women.” You must work even to be poor, and that is all you will get from them, enough, maybe, to keep you alive. It is good plan they invented. It has worked for a thousand years. <em>Brilliante</em>, <em>patri</em> Carmine says.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>I sleep on a box, made from wood scraps papa found in the fields, and covered with a thin mattress of heavy cloth, tightly stitched and stuffed with hay. My brothers sleep on the floor, over burlap that keeps them off damp earth. They are always sick and coughing, and I feel guilty that I sleep on a sort of bed, but there is no room. My sisters are with mama and papa, in the same room. For privacy, if it is ever needed, a blanket is hung from the ceiling. In a small <em>cuccina</em>, in the fall and winter, here mama and my sisters cook. Women are blessed, as they do not have the strength to dig and pull twelve hours a day, but they do die in childbirth, and for this reason and other reasons I am glad I was not born a woman. They are best suited for the kitchen work, but they do work the fields if needed, without pay, but the <em>capu’s</em> man will throw them a little fruit or a few vegetables. Rent for his shacks are already too low, <em>capu</em> says, so a little work for no pay, but a few vegetables, seems fair to him. There is a small cook pit in the kitchen, but it smokes. In the summer months, if we have a little meat, the women cook it in a pit behind the house. We eat under papa’s grape arbor. Some for us, some for the bugs, some for the stray dogs and wild cats, that mama will beat with a stick if they get close to the table. The shack is our home; as it is, dilapidated and falling down. The <em>capu</em> swears he is poor, like us, and cannot afford the wood and labor to make repairs.</p>
    <p>“What is your complaint?” he asks, leaning closer as if he is deaf and cannot hear. “Mud, mud. It is all I hear you people say. It has not rained two days in a row for years. You must make the repairs. What does it take to do a little here and a little there?” He shakes his head, in disgust, thinking we are all lazy. When he speaks of spending money, he gets angry.</p>
    <p>“If I make these unnecessary repairs, there will be an increase in the rent, so my children will not end up in the poor house.” He tells papa, “You make these repairs and the rent stays the same.” Papa agreed, but where is the money for materials, or the skill to make the repairs? What needed fixing before this grand deal, is still broken. The genius of this vile little man.</p>
    <p>Now it is our fault the house is falling apart. <em>Brilliante</em>.</p>
    <p>I am leaving for a place where I do not speak the language or know the customs. What will I do when I get there; where will I live and work? They have not invited me to come, but I do not believe they will turn me away at the gate. Maybe. They refused my uncle <em>Paolo</em>, two, or three times. Of the men I have known who left for this dream world, many have returned, telling stories of the horrible life in America. But more men have stayed, and to me this is the important number.</p>
    <p>Some think me a fool, like a woman, or any child; that I cannot see past the tip of my nose, and if I see it, I see it wrong. Protect yourself, they say. Save your ass. Believe the worst about everyone you know. See no good in any man.</p>
    <p>Ten men have stopped me on the street, in the <em>Piazza</em>, telling stories of grief I will find in America, if I am foolish enough to go. How many times I heard the story of <em>Signora Philomena Antonucci</em>, widowed by the typhoid; her husband not cold when her two sons run off to America, with plans of being rich and important, coming home their pockets stuffed with cash. But they are rotting in an American prison, for a crime their mother swears they did not commit; accused of robbing and beating an old man on a deserted street, in <em>Brukland</em>, in the U.S.A. Sent to prison for only ten years, since the man did not die. “<em>Grazie a Diu</em>,” she says and makes the sign of the cross, that a mob did not hang them dead, from some tree in some park. Her life is ruined, I understand, but what is this to me? I cannot believe in a rich country like America men are jailed for no good reason. What can these people think of me, by telling stories of horrible crimes, as if I am capable of the same thing. Tell me stories about men stealing apples, or grapes from a vineyard; this I would do, never rob and beat an old man. Such disrespect they show for me and my family.</p>
    <p>I spent last night wandering by the stream behind the shack; pacing until my legs were sore and swollen. Now the sun is up, over the horizon, and <em>Pantalioni’s</em> rooster has crowed three times. Or it is my imagination, and he has crowed once or twice. But it is a sign, that today would be a good day. Maria is already up an hour, peeling the few potatoes left in the bin, laying the skins in a neat pile, and papa will feed them to the goat. He has traded for a small sack of flour, a few tomatoes, a clove of garlic and six eggs, but one broke when he dropped the sack in the <em>piazza</em>. He gave a day’s labor for the food, that’s all he said, but I see mama’s shawl was not draped across her chair as it always is, and I believe it was sold to pay for the breakfast. I said nothing, promising myself I would replace it with a better shawl from the money earned in America. Mama has baked bread in the outside fireplace, built from stone cast off the <em>Difillio</em> shack, when it collapsed in the last quake. <em>Sig. Difillio’s</em> right leg was crushed when the chimney collapsed, and he was near it, trying to round up the four goats he owned. We will eat this last meal together, and no one will speak, and it will be solemn, like a wake and a funeral, until the food is gone, and papa clears his throat, and blames the rich landowners who rule <em>Sicilia</em>. If he prays, he will pray that the rich landowners, their families, rot in hell for all eternity.</p>
    <p>Papa is always up first. Hs says morning is the worst of the day, as nothing bad that is going to happen has yet happened, and all the hardship and suffering is yet to come. Night is the best. When he leaves the <em>bacous’</em> papa will tend the goat, feeding it peels and scraps, then walk to the <em>piazza</em> (for work) where he leans on the short, stone wall, and gazes at the sea and will make the sign of the cross and say a word about <em>grande mare degli dei</em> (Gods great sea).</p>
    <p>“She was calm, today,” he said, without emotion. “No wind, no bounce in her step.” He says I must live by the sea in America, and I nod and say I will.</p>
    <p>He worried on the goat, as it seemed sick, refusing to eat. The goat we call “papas’ goat,” is not his goat, but a loan from the <em>capu</em>, and only for milk, not meat. If it dies, the vile little man wants the carcass, no matter the condition. The last time he saw it, he complained the goat was in bad spirits, not happy and content. He knew animals, he said.</p>
    <p>“Have you mistreated it?” he says to papa, in an angry was, so papa knew he was serious.</p>
    <p>Papa worried the <em>capu</em> will give it to another family as part of their wages. Work for goat milk, no <em>lire</em>. Genius. Genius. Genius. As he left the shack, the <em>capu</em> tips his hat politely to the women in the room. “See the goat is healthy,” he says. “When this house has a new tenant, the goat goes with it.” Such a frail and pitiful little man; legs, thin like sticks and the arms of a boy, but like the <em>brigante</em>, he always had a knife to papa’s throat. The land is always first. Always the land, then the goddamned goat.</p>
    <p>Papa worked the fire in the pit, cursing the damp straw that would not catch. Mama allowed no cursing in her house (a house that was her house, like all homes belong to the woman) but for all other thing’s papa was the boss. He broke the rule when he took the Lord’s name in vain, and he apologized with a kiss to her cheek, making a solemn promise for the thousandth time, hand raised to the Almighty, saying he would never curse again. We ate in silence, like a last meal; no one spoke, only short looks and nods. Mama circled the table, sitting when everyone was served, but she never ate a scrap of her food, pushing it around the plate with her fork, a silver fork papa found in the <em>piazza</em>. Always tears in her eyes.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><em>Natale Chillemi</em>, my oldest cousin, was in America, for, and I only guess, five, or six years. We hear he worked twelve hours a day and went to school at night, learning to read and write, and other things about his new home. He wrote me two months ago, through some priest in <em>Brukland</em>, sending his address in America, that he wrote on two pieces of paper. One I tucked in the pocket of my work shirt, the other inside my right boot. <em>Natale</em> is doing good, he says; an honorable man, not likely to lie or exaggerate too much. He brought his whole family to America, <em>Assunta</em>, his wife and their boys, Paolo and Enrico. Paolo was a baby when they left, so he will have no memory of <em>Sicilia</em>. Enrico is ten, or twelve, and he will live between the two worlds for many years, and in the end, he will be American, and this makes his father happy.</p>
    <p>Now there is another child, Carmela, born in America and American and she will know nothing of her heritage. “A small price,” <em>Natale</em> says. He wrote there is much work on the American steam road. “And no problem saving money, if you are wise and do not fall in with a bad crowd or spend too much on wine and bad women, if you are not married.” He says he is in with the cops and politicians, and offers to be our sponsor, if we need one.</p>
    <p>“Use my name and where I live. Tell the immigration cops you will be with me. But tell them nothing, never, unless they ask, and you have no choice.” A nice letter, <em>Patri</em> said, well written, and mostly it makes sense. <em>Patri</em> brought the letter when he came to visit, a month ago at suppertime; mama, who says <em>Patri</em> is next to God, asked him to stay and share what we had. He agreed with some coaxing, swearing it was not his intention to eat on the Sparacino family, but to bring us this news from America. Me? I say this with no shame, that I am illiterate. To this day I do not write letters or read letters, or books or newspapers, except the pictures if they interest me. There was hope, many years ago, as <em>Patri</em> begged <em>Bishop Cunnio</em> to send a teaching nun be sent to the village, but he was refused. “What would be the use,” he said. “Ask when times are better.” After this <em>infamia</em>, <em>Patri</em> was ashamed to face us, that his superior put so little faith in his judgment. “I argued with his excellency to the edge of disrespect, but he was firm, in saying the nuns are better suited to teach in the city, where there is some hope.” Read and write? If everyman could read and everyman could write, who will push a plow, or pick the fruit or muck a stall? It is the nature of things that only the best should read, and the men who read and write should rule, as they are trained to think for men who cannot think for themselves. It is part of a grand plan, they say, and there was a time it made sense to me. Now I believe I know the truth, that the Church knows her place, and her place is next to the landowners and the politicians, to support them and defend this way of life by using God’s own words. This I am certain of.</p>
    <p>Prayer is free. <em>Patri</em> said he would pray for our safety, or should the worst happen, that God will welcome our souls into Heaven. I am mostly a believer, or a near believer, but what <em>Patri</em> said, that he would pray for my soul, is not what I hoped to hear. Yes, I have respect for this man, more as a man than a priest; reading and writing is what I needed from him, not the promise of salvation.</p>
    <p><em>Zia Theresa</em> told me that mama prays every day to <em>Sant’Agata</em>, begging that she cause some minor injury, a sprain to an ankle, or such, that would force me to stay when the rest go off to America. I feel good. No sickness or injury has been sent to me, thank God. Mama says <em>Patri</em> must use his authority, as a man of God, and forbid me to leave. He must save my soul, and there is good reason to believe America is an evil, sinful country, as it is not full Catholic. She was desperate to save me from a better life. A week past, I meet <em>Patri</em>, by chance, in the <em>Piazza Del Poppolo</em>, a winter night, but warm, almost humid. “Your mother fears for your safety,” he said, “but most of all your soul.” For near an hour he told stories, mostly heard from this man and that man, of the <em>Siciliani</em> who are suffering in America; a godless place, as he has come to believe. They treat us poorly, “like shit” were his words, as he bowed his head and asked forgiveness.</p>
    <p>“The <em>Siciliani</em> are murdered and imprisoned on the whim of politicians, mostly Irish politicians.” He bowed his head and made the sign of the cross.</p>
    <p>“The Holy Father sends the <em>Scalabrini’s</em> to care for the immigrant <em>Italiani</em>, because they cannot care for themselves in a strange country, that is filled with crime and hate for people like us.” What could I say to this, so I listened, fearing some of what he said was true? The good father stares me straight in the eye. “The <em>Scalabrini’s</em>? Would they be needed in a civilized country?” I was like a child caught. He pulled on his ear. “Mind you, this is what I hear, but from reliable men, not drunks or bums or thieves.” He took my shoulders. “The <em>Scalabrini’s</em>,” he said. “The <em>Scalabrini’s</em>…so I know it to be true.”</p>
    <p><em>Patri</em> was twice my age, maybe fifty, from <em>Messina</em>, twenty miles to the north. He served the King in the Italian Army before the seminary, they say; an officer, traveling through <em>Italia</em> and other counties and maybe farther. His vow to God and the Church came later in life. And like many men, he has strayed from the holy path, but always returned. He was proud to say he learned more about life from sinning, than reading the scriptures and hearing the word of God. He meant women, I believe, but I would not be disrespectful and ask, or ask others who knew him. <em>Si</em>. He meant women. I am certain. He left the army to follow God, asking that the Bishops allow him to enter the seminary, though he was older by twenty years than other seminarians.</p>
    <p>The bishops called him in and questioned his life as a man outside the Church. “Have you known women, not your wife?” one asked.</p>
    <p>“I have, your excellency. I was an officer. I knew many women, but I have repented.”</p>
    <p>They asked, “did you kill as a soldier?” He answered quickly, easily. “Thankfully, no, your excellency. I did not.”</p>
    <p>They asked, “would you have killed?” He thought and prayed (his lips were moving). “I would give to <em>Caesar</em> what was <em>Creasers</em> to have.”</p>
    <p>They huddled, prayed and drank wine, and welcomed him back to the Church.</p>
    <p>As was his good luck, <em>Patri’s</em> father was wealthy, owning thousands of <em>hectares</em> of prime growing land in ten provinces, with hundreds of men working during the high season. His reputation among other men of wealth was as a strong man and a leader, but the workers, I hear, hated him. The bishop wanted <em>Patri</em> sent to the <em>Vatican</em>, under the eyes of influential men, but <em>Patri</em> confessed his desire was to serve God by serving the peasants. He prayed, he petitioned, he begged. The bishop, though angry at this slight, that he was embarrassed in front of his superiors, sent him to the provinces where peasants were more “plentiful than trees.”</p>
    <p>My father’s mother is old and frail; her mind is gone, like yesterday is gone. She passes the day pulling grass and weeds, making neat piles for no reason, until the sun goes down. When I talk with her, she curses and claws at my arms, speaking foolishness, in some language I do not understand. When <em>Patri</em> visits she is different, calm and pleasant. They pray together, and for a time her talk is clear and clean, not empty. <em>Si</em>, he is a fine man, <em>Patri Carmine</em>; a man of wisdom and understanding, and I believe God listens to his prayers, but what does this priest know of America, or me, or my family? Nothing.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>I forced the good food down my throat, and after a respectable time of shuffling things on the table, I look at papa, who stared at the wall. He finished his meal, wiping with the old <em>mappina</em> he kept on his lap, and he tapped the table with his spoon and pointed to the door. It was time to leave, he said. I gathered what I had, no more than the clothes on my back and a bag under the table, that I thought mama might hide, thinking I would not leave without it. It is a possession I guarded, as it is all I have to show for the two years taken from me by the Italian Army. She was made of decent leather (from <em>Milano</em>), with two strong straps and a heavy buckle, made of solid brass; no less than two keys, one for my pocket, the other I kept in my right boot, under the paper with directions to my cousin’s house. For this fine leather satchel, I give five <em>lire</em> to a foolish soldier, a gambler, they say, and a drunk, in need of money for <em>grappa</em> and bad women. I am certain he stole it from another officer, but no matter, as I suspect he was a thief, who stole it from someone else, or strong-armed it from a common soldier. <em>Enrico Rezzi</em>, <em>il Sindaco</em> (the mayor), offered me twenty <em>lire</em> for the bag, but I laughed, I refused, and how good it felt saying no to an important man.</p>
    <p>My brother, Paolo, faced me. We embraced, wishing each other well and ‘God speed.’ He leaned to me and whispered, “I will join you if you call and the time is right.” We embraced again, and he stepped back against the wall and dropped his head.</p>
    <p>Salvatore stood quietly, like a shadow, staring at the dirt floor, refusing to answer when I called for him. My sister Agata cried. Maria comforted her, but soon they were both crying, and leaning on each on the others shoulder. This saddened me, but the truth, I felt good it was a bad day for them because I was leaving. I took a last look; everything was neat and pleasant, and now it seemed too good to leave. Was I <em>stunado</em>? The shack was not a shack, but a mansion; the dirt floor, the finest tile from <em>Palermu</em>. I grab at the door; thick oak, smooth and varnished, and hung solidly on three heavy iron hinges. Our family name, Sparacino, was always to be engraved on a fine metal plate hung on the door, but the <em>Capu</em>, the foolish little bastard of a man said no, it was not our house, not our door. We always knew what he meant.</p>
    <p>Sparacino, on a plate, or not, was still a proud name in the village. The little bastard.</p>
    <p>Neighbors crowded in the street to see me off and say “<em>buona fortuna</em>.”</p>
    <p><em>Signora Martini</em>, mama’s oldest friend, took my hand and squeezed, I thought to wish me well, or say she would pray for my safe return. But no, she asked for a favor. Her sister, I forget the name, left the village last year, to join her husband and son, somewhere in America. Not a word since that day, and she is worried for her sister, that she is dead or in jail. “If you see them, the <em>Calabano’s</em>, ask when they are coming home.” Of course. If I see her. What else could I say to this childless widow, who is alone (what worse thing could happen to a woman?). When her sister married and left the village, they met at the top of the mountain road, and hugged each other and cried and theirs lives changed forever once they said goodbye.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Mama and my sisters were holding hands, while they thanked the neighbors for their good wishes and prayers. Mama looked away as she cried; I took her hand, she pulled away, saying I did not love her as a son should love his mother, or I would not abandon her. I grab the edge of the old apron she wore and wiped the tears from her eyes. Her face was a mother’s face, but too old, too weathered for a woman not yet <em>cinquanta anni</em>. Fifty years old.</p>
    <p>“Abandon you? Is that what you think?”</p>
    <p>She moved close and hugged me, refusing to let go, but would not answer my question, other than saying she was an old woman, and I should not pay her any attention. She was losing her son to a dream, so she was in mourning. I asked again, did she think I was abandoning the family? Papa shook his head, took mama by the hand and they both stepped back, but she pulled away and came back to me, like the stubborn woman I loved and respected.</p>
    <p>“We will be better off. This is my promise to you,” I said.</p>
    <p>She nodded and kissed my hand, begging that I return in one piece, not corrupted by the evils she heard that tormented the <em>Americano’s</em>. She held my face in her hands.</p>
    <p>“<em>Accura</em>,” she said, I recall. “<em>Accura</em>. Be careful,” the tears dropping from her cheeks. Another embrace, another kiss on the cheek, and she took a few steps back, feeling for papas’ hand. He stepped in mama’s place, his old, woolen cap tipped to the left, and he smiled, a forced smile, I believe. He put two <em>lire</em> in my hand, then closed it and held it tight to his chest. “This is for you,” he said. “I saved for this day, but the rent. I am ashamed I cannot do more.” He leaned to me. “I thought on selling the goddamned goat and swear to Castello it chewed through the rope and ran off.” We laughed. “But I was afraid the sonofabitch would want one of my children in its place.”</p>
    <p>“Castello would throw you out,” I said. “He loves the goat more than his wife.”</p>
    <p>Papa laughed. “The goat is better looking,” he said, and we both laughed. It was true.</p>
    <p>Papa stared at the faces of the friends and neighbors who came to see me off. He spoke to the crowd, like a sinner making his public confession. “It is my fault…my fault, he is leaving.” He hid his face in his giant hands and cried. This I never expected.</p>
    <p>“Be careful,” he said to me. “Advice is all I have to give…what is two <em>lire</em>?” “You and mama come to America. I will tell Luca and Santo to stay home.”</p>
    <p>He wiped his eyes; we hugged. “A joke,” he said, “a good one,” but did he laugh?</p>
    <p>“If I was still a young man,” he said, not meaning it. I wished it was him and mama, not Luca and Santo.</p>
    <p>Maria is my sister. Like all women, family is everything to her. She will marry <em>Carmine Sisto</em>, a gentle man, like papa, and her duty will be to her husband and her children, but she will never forget our family. When mama is too old to work, Maria will do her work, gladly taking care of two families. No bitch or complaint. Maria and mama and Agatha, they pray to <em>Sant’ Agata</em> for my safety. No one has said it, or have I asked, but I know.</p>
    <p>“You are doing the right thing,” Maria said as we hugged until the end. “You have nothing to be ashamed of.” She took from her apron pocket a rosary, white beads, and wrapped it around my hand. A cherished gift from our grandmother, and with the clothes on her back, all she can say is her own. No. I would not take it. Never would I take it.</p>
    <p>“Maria, I cannot take this.” I kissed the crucifix and slipped the rosary over her head and down to her shoulders.</p>
    <p>“Save it. When I come back, you give it to me as a welcome home gift.” She nodded. She smiled. What wild and beautiful eyes, and I will miss her. “But pray for me,” I said, “wear the white off the beads.”</p>
    <p>My brothers, Paolo and Salvatore, stood close. Paolo hugged me again. Not a word went between us; what do men say at these times? It is best nothing is said. Salvatore turned his back to me and walked away, toward the arbor. I called to him.</p>
    <p>“Salvatore. Walk with me to the mountain road,” but he kept on and would not look back. “He is upset,” Paolo said. “It is nothing. He will come around…his hero is leaving.” I thought I could change his mind before I left; he would not let me go without saying goodbye. But he did.</p>
    <p>Agata. Agata, <em>secondo</em>. So quiet. I see the sadness in her eyes, for me.</p>
    <p>She hugged hard, leaving me near breathless. “Who will protect me when you are gone?” She kissed my hands, as the tears dropped from her beautiful green eyes.</p>
    <p>Deep green, like a thousand oceans.</p>
    <p>“Paolo and Salvatore will protect you. Or if they are busy maybe <em>Signuri Testa</em>.” “<em>Signuri Testa</em>?” She laughed. “<em>Signuri Testa</em>...the old man…he can barely walk...he cannot even take care of his goats.” My last gift to her was a joke, and she laughed.</p>
    <p>From the corner of my eye, I watch Salvatore pacing at the arbor, half in, half out, but he still ignored me, and I did not go to him, as I have regretted most of my life. I believe he gave me a slight nod of his head, and would walk with me to the mountain road, but he is too proud, too stubborn for a child. “Write Salvatore when you get to America,” papa says. “Explain yourself. Tell him what you told me…you will buy land with the money you save…tell him that. If you told him, tell him again.” I tried one more time with Salvatore, at least to shake his hand if there was no hug between us, but he would have no part of it and walked into the woods.</p>
    <p>I could not wait. Luca and Santo were waiting in the <em>Piazza</em>. I was late. “<em>Arrivaderci a tutti</em>,” I said.</p>
    <p>“<em>Arrivaderci Antonino…God be with you</em>.”</p>
    <p>Salvatore stared at me from inside a line of scrubby trees only for a second, then looked away, and this last memory of him I have kept in my mind these years. Mama and papa wanted to walk with me to the <em>piazza</em>. We went a block, to <em>Via Catania</em>, when I hear a deep voice call my name. I think for an instant, “Salvatore?” But his voice was not a man’s voice.</p>
    <p>“<em>Antonino</em>! <em>Aspetti</em>, wait.” <em>Patri Carmine</em>, black robe flapping like the wings of a bird. “<em>Uno momento</em>,” he shouted, “<em>uno momento</em>,” waving his arms to get my attention.</p>
    <p>We met on <em>Via Golia</em>, where <em>Patri</em> was doubled over to rest until he could talk. But a strong man, he recovered quick. He was sorry for holding me up.</p>
    <p>“My brother Salvatore? Did he send you?” I asked, only hoping. “Salvatore? No, no. I saw him walk into the woods. What do you mean?”</p>
    <p>“<em>Non importanta</em>, <em>Patri</em>.” He smiled. “<em>Si</em>. I understand,” he says. “But you cannot leave without my blessing.” He took papa’s hand and they traded kind words; mama, still angry he could not convince me to stay, looked away, but he smiled at her and reached for her hand, and she pulled away and turned her back her back on him.</p>
    <p>“I am sorry, <em>Signora Faraone</em>. I did my best, but what am I? A simple parish priest, but I believe his soul is watched over by God, and these decisions are His to make.” Mama nodded respectfully, looked away and spoke to a passing neighbor woman, <em>Signora Blasi</em>. I believe it was her, but I did not get a good look. A blessing from a priest like <em>Patri Carmine</em> was a good thing to have, but he was not Salvatore, and it was Salvatore whose good wish I wanted, but he was holding a grudge I could not reason out of him. In his mind I was abandoning our family. It was not the truth, but he was a child and what do children know of the truth.</p>
    <p>How embarrassed I was to be the center of everything, and <em>Patri</em> sees this and puts his hands on my shoulders.</p>
    <p>“This <em>testa dura</em>, your son,” he says, looking straight at mama and papa, “Is a hard-headed man who will not listen to reason, but I pray anyway for his safety and quick return, God willing.” Mama ignored him; thanked <em>Signora Blasi</em> for the <em>Novena’s</em> said for my safety, then wished her goodbye. The <em>signora</em> hugged me and wished me “<em>Buona fortuna</em>,” and left. Mama faced <em>Patri</em>, who was a nervous man, so that his hands trembled, and his face was white.</p>
    <p>“Never,” she said. “My first born will not listen. <em>Si</em>, you are right <em>Patri</em>…he is <em>testa dura</em>.” Now mama was acting friendly to the priest, but still she glared and refused to smile.</p>
    <p>“Kneel and I will give a blessing,” he said. I knelt on the street with papa (mama stepped away). The sharp edge of a jagged stone pierced my knee, and it was sore and swollen for days, but it did not bleed.</p>
    <p>“I will ask God to watch over you and your companions,” <em>Patri</em> said, closing his eyes, raising his hands to the heavens. I bow my head.</p>
    <p>“<em>In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritūs Sancti</em>... in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit…God in heaven, keep your child, Antonino Sparacino, and his fellow travelers, Santo Sparacino and Luca Ponto, safe on their journey to America, and hasten their return to the arms of their families, to the place they were born. But should some accident or calamity occur, I pray you welcome them, your children, with open arms, into the kingdom of heaven, for all eternity.”</p>
    <p>Men mock these prayers, saying they are the superstition of ignorant men and old women. Me? What do I know? A thousand blessing I have been given in my life; a blessing for this and that, for birth and death and all in between. Am I the worse for it? Who knows? I am alive, but I shovel shit for a living, and pick fruit, when I can find the work. What has it done for me? I am here and breathing, but dirt poor. I leave my home and my family, saying I am looking for fortune; but the truth, I leave with the hope of a goddamned job, no more than a steady wage at the end of the day. <em>Metà e metà</em>. Half and half. Fifty-fifty. What do I know? But I have said it before. <em>Patri</em> leads me to the side of the street; quiet, he was, like he had seen death, the grim reaper, as the <em>Americani</em> say. “Before you leave,” he said, almost pleading, “Stop and see your grandmother. She is near the end. God will call her soon. I am certain of it.”</p>
    <p>‘I will, <em>Patri</em>, if I am able, but you see…”</p>
    <p>“She may not know you, but think of your guilt if she dies before you return…and she will…and you have not said goodbye?” He shakes his head. “I cannot imagine your sorrow.”</p>
    <p>I saw her a few days ago, my grandmother, when I delivered winter tomatoes; pay from <em>Sig Tilluli</em>, for repairing stone in the stable behind his house. <em>Nonna</em> was kneeling by the stream, talking on with someone not there. Her mind is gone from old age, and she spends the day pulling grass and weeds from the ground, heaping it all in a neat pile, but she seemed at peace, and it was all right with me.</p>
    <p>“I understand,” <em>Patri</em> says, as he put his hand on my shoulder.</p>
    <p>“Maybe, if she is able, if she knows who you are, you will pray with her?” I lied to him, this man who baptized me, who once said he would die to save my soul.</p>
    <p>“I will, <em>Patri</em>. Yes. I was going to stop before I left,” and at this he smiled.</p>
    <p>“<em>Grazie</em>,” he said, taking my hand and we embraced. “I must leave now. <em>Signuri Bustari</em> is sick…like your grandmother. I promised to stop and pray with the family.” He wished me luck and <em>buona fortuna</em> (good fortune).</p>
    <p>“When you come home, and with God’s help, you will have grown as a man.”</p>
    <p>“A rich man, <em>Patri</em>. <em>Si</em>. Maybe I will be a rich man, with money and land and I will die my own boss.” He pulled his ear and grabbed my arm.</p>
    <p>“<em>Ascolti</em>, listen to me. Never surrender to this sinful greed that is all around us. Too many <em>contadini</em> covet the wealthy. These men, men you think are great men, but remember, they must lose their riches to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. This is what I believe.” I have heard him speak many times about greed, maybe a hundred times, and he always says the same thing, and I always ask myself, how can a man, like me, with nothing, be a greedy man?</p>
    <p>“Hear me, Antonino and believe me when I say it, these bastards will cower when they face the Lord at last. What good will all their wealth be in the fires of hell?” I nod.</p>
    <p>“I will ask Castello when I see him, ‘Will you give it back to save your soul?’” He laughed and let loose of my arm, and I stepped back.</p>
    <p>“Enough preaching for today,” he said. “You have a great journey ahead of you. God speed and keep you safe.” He shook papa’s hand and bowed to mama, but he did not take her hand, and she did not offer it. He turned toward the mountain, his great black robes snapping in the wind. Mama was tired, short of breath. She grabbed papa’s hand and squeezed tight, saying she could not walk another step toward the mountain road. She was crying when she took my hands and papa hugged her frail shoulders.</p>
    <p>“I cannot watch you disappear from sight,” she said, so softly. “I will think you are not coming back…that I will never see you again. I can think of nothing worse.”</p>
    <p>“No, <em>mamma</em>, please. I promise I will be back. What will stop me?”</p>
    <p>“You owe us nothing, Antonino. You must do what is best for your life, but it is painful for me to see you leave, even when you promise to return.” When I saw her like this, the woman who gave me life, I thought, is it worth a few miserable acres of land to make her suffer? What kind of man am I? A <em>cavone</em> who feeds his mother to the dogs, for the chance to make a few dollars, to own a pile of rocks, for this is all I will ever afford. No matter. Selfish. In what world, or in what time would they do this to me? Never. I could not watch these wonderful people suffer any more. I took her hands. She would not look me in the eyes.</p>
    <p>“I will not go, mama. I will stay. We will make do and survive. I cannot…” She turned to me, angry, her thin, crooked finger an inch from my face.</p>
    <p>“You will not quit before you start…you will go to America like you said, and you will make your own way. When you are ready to come home, tell <em>Patri</em> and he will tell me, and I will meet you at the top of the road and we will walk through the <em>Piazza</em> together.” She put her <em>Sant’ Agata</em> medal in my hand. “Take my mother’s medal that her mother gave her when she married my father.” Mama pointed to the spire of the Church where she was baptized and married and will be buried from when she is dead. “Now go. Your friends are waiting.” She hugged me a last time. Papa tipped his cap, and they walked away, arm and arm, leaning on each other for strength.</p>
    <p>“<em>Arrivaderci</em>,” I whisper to myself.</p>
    <p>They stopped at the corner, and papa leaned and said something to mama, and gently patted her hand; she nodded and they turned onto <em>Via Spiritu Sancto</em>, and disappeared into the shadow. I froze, alone in the narrow street, like an orphan, a lost child, afraid to move. I say this, my right hand to God, I would have stayed and made the best of my life, if there was a chance I would never see them again. But I have seen them often in <em>spirt</em> and in my dream. I have seen them walk away, every day for fifty years, and it has taken much of the joy from my life.</p>
    <p>A swirling gust of cool wind woke me. I moved on, past the <em>Renduzzi</em> shack, vacant a year, since they went to America. The street is near empty, and some shacks were empty, and so the stables. Many had left; some returned broken, their plan for a better life failed. <em>Ferdinando Renduzzi</em> and his wife, <em>Carmela Paone</em>, took their children and left, not bothering to bolt the door or board the windows (they did not own the house and stood months behind in the rent).</p>
    <p>The <em>Giacobbe’s</em>, the <em>Fiumara’s</em>, the <em>Rao’s</em>, all in America, or <em>Argentina</em>. The ones who come back are one their knees, broke and broken, no better off than when they left. Every man who fails has his story, and the reason for his failure. If only they had a few dollars, they would be millionaires. You need money to make money. This excuse I heard many times, like an echo, bouncing from the walls, back and forth, day and night.</p>
    <p>“No one would hire me because I am <em>Siciliano</em>. I could not find work.”</p>
    <p>“The winters are cold…the goddamned snow…and the heat…worse than <em>Sicilia</em>.” “The <em>Americani</em>. They are like barbarians.” Lies became truths and the truth whatever each man wanted it to be.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Santo and Luca? Are they there, waiting for me? <em>Si</em> or no?</p>
    <p>I say yes, but if no, I will find two more, or stay home and go another day. I breathed easy when I see my cousin, <em>Santo Sparacino</em>, on the steps of the Church; short and slight, he is smaller than me, the smallest man in our family. Thank God, he showed. And <em>Luca Ponto</em>, who is not family, bit a fine friend and a good man to have in a fight. He was the first to say we should go to America. It was a bad night in <em>Agosto</em>, seven months ago; the air so thick, just to breathe was misery. We were drinking wine in the <em>Piazza</em>, and Luca was drunk, said a breeze off the mountain would feel good. He brought wine he drained from his uncle’s best barrel, as I recall. Or maybe he stole it. He was trying to attract a young girl, the peddler’s daughter, a real beauty, who came with her father from <em>Napoli</em>, selling his wares, mostly pots and pans. Luca felt sorry for the girl, he said, as she was shy and paid him little mind, and this he could not understand. She was doing all the heavy work, while her <em>cavone</em> of a father drank wine and <em>grappa</em> and babbled on, like ten old women at a table. A few times she smiled at him and flashed her sea green eyes, and these smiles so turned his head, he bought a fancy metal pot from her, only to lose it to a fool a few nights later playing <em>briscola</em>, he later claimed was rigged and dishonest.</p>
    <p>That night I speak of, we were quiet from all the wine, and wondering on the next bottle. Santo complained about the heat, bad for even <em>Agosto</em>, and he coughed hard, like a man ready to die. As I remember, it was that night we decided to leave <em>Sicilia</em>, and make our way in the world. Who said it first? That we should leave and maybe not come back. I believe Luca said it first. But he was drunk. So, did it count? We were all drunk.</p>
    <p>“Why are we still here? Is this paradise?” Luca said it loud and firm, in his great voice. None of us had a good answer.</p>
    <p>Our village gets smaller every day, and one day it would be gone, except for me and Luca and Santo, and the old men and women, and a few sickly children. Empty. <em>Vuoto</em>. No one here. Men left on a whim, some leaving family behind, if they had family. That guy over there, yesterday he was here, next to you in the field; today he is gone, and you are talking to yourself. “He went to <em>Palermu</em> for work,” someone would say. “Or America. <em>Si</em>, he has a brother in America…or a cousin…who can remember?” So, you think, if there is a little work, even a few days, a few hours, maybe tomorrow will be better than today. Not for Luca. It was simple for Luca, as the truth came to him in a dream. His bed shook, violent. He wakes and the village is empty; his bed in now in the middle of some courtyard, surrounded by high walls, only one door in or out, and the door slowly closes, making him a prisoner, like in a jail cell. He shakes and swats, but everyone does in bad dreams. After telling the story, he stood and pounds the table, hard, so that two glasses fall to the stone and break in a thousand pieces. He looks. Who saw it? Who heard it? He sighs.</p>
    <p>“A voice tells me to get out before the door closes and traps me, forever.”</p>
    <p>The wind kicked up, and the dirt and dead leaves swirled, and the old men held onto their caps, as they cursed and wiped girt and shit from their eyes. Luca takes Santo’s glass and pours himself wine, or <em>grappa</em>. I do not recall. He puts his nose to the rim of the glass. The wine smelled good he said, and is a shame to drink it, but he does, and said he hoped there will be good <em>Sicilian</em> wine in America, because he has decided to live in America, but we are welcome to come. This was the first I heard he wanted to leave; yes, now I am certain. He said it first.</p>
    <p>“Powerful men, they rule the world,” the voice in his dream declares.</p>
    <p>“We are dropped here, the voice tells me, and there is little chance to escape.” Santo laughs, an annoying laugh, like a squeaking door that wants oil.</p>
    <p>“They? Who are ‘they?’ he asks Luca. “It is always ‘they’ said this, and ‘they’ said that. When you cannot prove what you say, ‘they’ said it, ‘But I forget his name.’ I have a story my <em>zio Enrico</em> has told many times…no ‘they’ said this, or ‘they’ said that. It is from him, and he was a great man. More wine?” I took half a cup, and Santo refused, as all he wanted to do was talk about goddamned <em>zio Enrico</em>.</p>
    <p>“In America, my <em>zio</em> swears, his right hand to God, the money lays in the street. It falls from the pockets of the rich bastards, too lazy to bend and pick it up.” Santo’s <em>zio</em>, I know this man. He has never been to America, or off the mountain in twenty years, but he heard it from a man who says he has been there many times.</p>
    <p>Luca laughs. “A story to please fools. Who leaves money in the street? Not a rich man, who would not be rich long if he did.” Santo defends his uncle.</p>
    <p>“My <em>zio</em> is no liar,” he said, “so what he says cannot be a lie.” <em>Si</em>, Santo was for America.</p>
    <p>Santo and Luca. Me? What is here for me? Nothing is my answer and I have said this to Carmela, that maybe another place is better. She swears she will leave her family and follow me where I go. Of course. She is a fine <em>Sicilian</em> woman, and for that I am thankful. Is America the hope? <em>Si</em>, I will go, to make just enough money to buy land. Then I ask myself if it is good, why should I come back?</p>
    <p>We go. It was decided. We raised our cups to the mountain, as if the mountain was God. “The time has come,” Luca says, hard and shaking his fist, like a man with confidence, like a boss. Like Castello would say. Santo nodded; he agreed, but I said nothing, staring off to the sea. I have heard men say, <em>Americani</em> are soft and lazy; they hate us because we work harder and longer, like oiled machines, and we will work until we drop, with no complaint. We banged our empty cups with great enthusiasm, on the stone table; we knew what we said was right. Now the truth will be told. I like wine, how it tastes and smells, but I have no tolerance for it. The bad choices I have made, I have made staring at the bottom of an empty cup, but this was no bad choice. I felt it in my gut, that ached. My hands trembled; I hid them in my pockets, like some fool.</p>
    <p>How many nights since that night? Two, three, maybe four and I have been drunk for many of them.</p>
    <p>Both men were there, thanks God. Santo was sitting on the Church steps, leaning back on his elbows, and his eyes closed to the glare of the morning sun. Luca is wide awake, alert, like a sentry. His eyes follow an old farmer leading a decrepit mule across the square, past the church, that our ancestors built four hundred years ago, as a tribute to the goodness of the Lord and to the honor of our patron, <em>Sant’Agata</em>, who was born in <em>Catania</em>, close to <em>Monte Etna</em>, but not here.</p>
    <p><em>Patri</em> tells the story at her feast day, describing the mutilation she suffered from barbarians, but God loved her so much, her body has never rotted, or will it ever rot.</p>
    <p>It was a cool morning, following a night that was hot as hell, and the air was thick, it was hard to breathe. The sky was clear of clouds, deep and blue, a pleasant thing to see. The sun was bright, but not cruel to the eyes. The first good day in a month, and a good day to work in the fields, but today we leave and will miss a day’s pay. Santo saw me as I came out of the shadows. He nudged Luca. They grab their bags and we met in the middle of the square, but not speaking as we came together. I look to their eyes for a sign of weakness, and they did it to me and each other. Who has lost his courage, and what excuse will he use?</p>
    <p>“My family needs me. They will starve without me.” “Things will be better. Why leave on such a beautiful day?” “Tomorrow is another day.”</p>
    <p>Santo is my cousin, the son of <em>Pietro Sparacino</em>, my father’s brother. There is not much to say about Santo, he is a simple man, but that he is married to <em>Agata Rossi</em>, a woman, good or bad, on who is telling the story. He was not in the army, let off because of a sickness (heart, they said) but he still worked the fields, good as any man. and I see no good reason why he was not drafted, as the sonofabitches took me with bad lungs( bad as I see them ). This made of him the village hero for a few days, because he failed and beat them and their draft. When the army came to round up men, <em>Signuri Pellini</em>, the <em>sindaco</em> (mayor) at that time, gives this spit shined officer, a true believer, the names of men who were the right age, and would swear their allegiance to the King. A tent was set up in the <em>piazza</em>, wherein an army doctor examined each man summoned.</p>
    <p>Six, I believe. All showed as ordered, except <em>Gino Marcotta</em>, who was flushed out of the woods behind the Church, by two <em>Carabinieri</em>, who dragged him back to the <em>Piazza</em> in chains, while preaching to him his duty to <em>Italia</em>. Gino was a plain cripple, as any man could see; his one leg maybe an inch, or two, shorter than the other. A malady from birth, I believe. His short leg caused him great pain, and worse, he suffered ridicule his whole life. The army doctors said this was no matter and passed him for service over the loud complaint of his uncle, who took in Gino when his father was killed by a runaway wagon that overturned and crushed him to death. They passed him, I believe, only as an example to other men, since he did not show as ordered, being dragged in chains, in front of the whole village. This message was clear: If we do this to a cripple, what will we do to you?</p>
    <p>“What use will he be in a fight?” his uncle protested, as they lead Gino away, like a frightened woman, screaming and kicking.</p>
    <p>“He can muck stables, and polish boots,” they said. “There is work to do, even for a...”</p>
