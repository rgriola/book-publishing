<!--  A Ship's Error and Steerage
Emil D'Arrico loses his ticket. Antonino's name is wrong on the manifest, and they board the vile steerage cabin.
-->
<div class="chapter-body">

<p class="calibre4">The gangplank was wide and solid and did not move, or bounce, like the plank on the ferry, but it was a hard climb, more like a steep hill with rocks, and my legs burned when I reached the top. I stepped aside to let others pass, as I took my last look at Italia. How painful it was to see her for the last time.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">This is when I saw her, the young girl from Colleberardi, struggling with her suitcase, dragging it up the steep plank. She smiled and stopped, as if there was a question, but she asked nothing of me and moved on. I leaned on the railing, searching across the wharf, and I saw them through the dim light, the D’arrico’s, Emil pacing in front of the bench. Luca stopped and watched, and Santo shouted to them, but the wind was strong, carrying the sound out to sea.             </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What are they doing?” Santo asked, as if I should know. I thought to lie, for no reason but to save Emil’s reputation, but we would never meet again, so what did it matter?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Emil lost their tickets. He has no money after paying off the priest. He asked for a loan. I said no.”  Luca scoffed every time I mentioned Emil’s name. He hated him, for no other reason, I believe, than Emil had Amaria, and Luca did not. He seemed to enjoy the family’s misfortune.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Lost the tickets? A fool loses his tickets,” he said. Enzo squeezed onto the rail.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who are these people we are staring at? Friends?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They <i class="calibre5">are</i> friends,” I said. “But they have not been friends for long. Only a few days. They are good and decent people. The wife, Amaria, is a charitable woman, but her decency has sunk them all.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca stood with his back to the dock, “Charity is the pastime of fools,” he said. “Good riddance to the whole family.” He did not mean it, since it was clear to all he plainly coveted Amaria from the second we met. Enzo was sorry for their difficulty, he said, “but what fool puts a stranger over family?  These words made Enzo uncomfortable, as I could tell.   </p>
<p id="page_485" class="calibre6">“Luca, have you heard the priest say, ‘charity covers a multitude of sin?’” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course, I have. Am I a barbarian? But always take care of number one.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo looked frustrated to me, maybe realizing he was speaking to a stone wall. He looked again to the D’Arrico’s, who were still on the dock.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino. If they are your friends, I would gladly lend them a little money. If you speak for them, then I trust they would pay it back.” I turned and took Enzo by the arm.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You have money to lend?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. A little. Not much. I have saved for a long time.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Hundreds were coming came up the gangplank, hordes of people, like the rich woman said. How do I get past them on the way down? I should have asked Enzo in the first place if he had money to lend, bur we barely know him.  He went to his poke and handed me fifty lire, enough to buy tickets for the family. I fought my way to the railing and called out to Emil, but the noise from the wharf was like a wall. I shout again, and I thought maybe he heard me, when I see him move, but they started walking toward the city. I ran back along the railing like a crazy man, yelling his name. “Emil…Emil,” until I hit the gangplank; a man shoved me, saying I was  “p<i class="calibre5">azzo,</i>” as he pushed me away. Emil looked back toward the gangplank, and I was sure he heard me call. I waved wildly, yelling his name, but he turned away and they went lost in the crowd. I push my way halfway down the gangplank, where a cop grabbed my arm.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you leave you cannot return,” he said. I stopped. My feet anchored to the plank. What do I do, I ask myself?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I did what any decent man would do. I went back and found Enzo and returned his fifty lire, thanked him and said the money was no longer needed. I knew I would never see these people again; at that moment I promised Emil, in spirit, anyway, I would pray for him and his family, that they would be safe and prosper wherever they went. Enzo stuffs the fifty into a pocket. </p>
<p id="page_486" class="calibre6">“It is ironic how life takes its turns, some good, some bad,” he said.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Ironic? What did this word mean? I did not ask him to explain.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The wind came from Napoli city, full and cold and steady, sometimes furious. Women held their hats, but a few ended in the sea and the women all said the same thing, it was her best hat, and it would be missed. One woman, I recall, cried, no, she wept, and her husband put his arm around her shoulder, promising he would buy her another in America, and she smiled. The line moved, slow and monotonous, like all lines, even the fastest lines.  A short, stub of a man, an official looking man, a ledger tucked under his right arm, forced his way through the line. His bearing was proper, like an officer, and when he turned quick, he caught staring at him and I was embarrassed  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo stood tight at my side, too close for a man to be, so I nudge him back.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your friends?  What do they think of me?” he asked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are welcome to travel with us, but you are on your own.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He was happy with this and smiled. “But what do they think of me? Have they said?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We forgive you for not being Siclianu.” He laughed, thinking it a joke, but no, it was not. “If you cause us any trouble, well, you will have to deal with Luca. Not me.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Trouble?  No, of course not. I respect that you have told me the truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Near the door to Third Class(steerage)was the officer who broke through the line, and I see his uniform was well-tailored, shaped to his body, though he was a short and stubby man. </p>
<p id="page_487" class="calibre4">But clean shaven. Odd thing, I thought, it is late, near midnight and he looked too good for a night detail. A clean shave is Church on Sunday, even for an officer.  He was checking names off the manifest; when my turn came, I took two steps forward.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Name?” he said, still looking in his manifest book.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Antonino Sparacino,</i>” I said it proudly, but as he ignored me and flipped through the pages of his book, I smelled the shit that was coming my way.          </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Vediamo</i>,” he says, slowly, as his eyes (that were too close together) check up and down the manifest. “I have a *<i class="calibre5">Sporino</i>, from <i class="calibre5">Montepalgano</i>, but he is <i class="calibre5">Giuseppe</i>, not <i class="calibre5">Antonino</i>.” He squinted in the poor light. “This is the ‘<i class="calibre5">Antonio Lopez. </i>Are you on the right ship? Are you confused?” He pointed to another ship in the harbor. “She is the Victor Emmanuel, leaving for Argentina in the morning. Maybe you are on that ship?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, signuri, I am on the right boat.” I stayed calm, neither angry or excited, as maybe he did not hear me good. “Not Sporino. I am <i class="calibre5">Sparacino.</i>” He nodded and looked again, but I think he just flipped pages, not too concerned if I was there, or not.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Sparacino</i>? Are you sure it is not <i class="calibre5">Sporino</i>, and he proceeded to spell it? <i class="calibre5">S-p-o-r-i-n-o</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">The goddamned fool. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It has been ‘<i class="calibre5">Sparacino</i>’ for a thousand years, as I know. Maybe longer. My father is Orazio, and his father is Antonino, and I am named for him. We are <i class="calibre5">Sparacino. </i>I am<i class="calibre5"> Sparacino.</i>” The line behind was restless, except for Luca and Santo and Enzo, who are friends, but I hear clear calls from the rest, who were not friends, that I should step aside. I could see the officer was getting impatient, and I would certainly lose.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiace</i>, but you are not here. I mean you are not on the manifest. I cannot let you board. You are on the wrong ship…that is easy if you are not….” </p>
<p id="page_488" class="calibre6">Enzo pushed me aside. “Please, signore,” he says to the officer, but respectfully. “May I see the manifest?” and in seconds he finds the error, when the officer could not.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Here it is.” He points to a line on the sheet. “<i class="calibre5">Sparacino</i> is with an ‘S,’ but you have filed my friend under the “F’s’ after *‘<i class="calibre5">Francino</i>.’ Your clerical staff simply confused the letters, that’s all.”  The officer apologized to Enzo, and thanked him for finding the error, but declared, for certain he would have found it, sooner or later. He said nothing to me. <i class="calibre5">Niente.</i> Nothing, I was invisible and not there.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Regrettably” he said, my purser has poor penmanship.” He grabbed my ticket and wrote on it “Deck S– Section A.” I give him my hand to shake, but he ignored it, staring over my shoulder to the rest of the line. “Next,” he said. No matter. He was not an important man, like the captain, or the man who runs the pump, if there is a pump. He played with the paper he held, like a child plays with blocks, shuffling them from one pile to another.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Of what use is he, except in his own mind? He cleared his throat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Follow the line to deck S,” he said. “Do not stop in the corridors. You must keep the line moving.” I nodded and stepped out to wait for the others; Luca and Enzo passed through fine, as did Santo once he found his ticket, that he had hidden in his left boot for safe keeping. We follow the line, making many turns, then finally through a heavy metal door, that closed on its own, but two sailors held it open. Down a narrow iron stairway, with wooden treads that were wet and slippery and foul looking as if  someone spilt a pail of grease on the treads.  Painted on a wall at the bottom of the first landing, or second landing, I forget, was a bold, red line with two arrows drawn from it, one pointing to the ceiling, the other down, toward the floor.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Someone has made a joke of the water line,” Enzo said. I saw it. Who needed twenty years of school to know what it meant? I edged my way to the wall, and I see my nose was just above the line, but not so Santo, and when he asked what it was, Enzo blamed some fool with a paint brush, and nothing better to do.   </p>
<p id="page_489" class="calibre6">The passage was a narrow way, barely room for big man to walk, or two small men, and the walls seemed to move and close on me and I thought of grapes in a wine press. The   down there was wetter and fouler than the air one deck up.  A tall man was stooping, for no other reason than he could not stand erect, and he appeared nervous and unsettled and all of a sudden, he yells that he could not take it anymore, and pushed his way back to the stairs. I thought, was he the first victim of this journey; he was, unless the D’arrico’s are counted, or the woman on the dock. I thought more on it and put him six, as the woman on the gangplank was certainly dead, God rest her soul, and the D’arrico’s were friends. A man nudges me from behind. “Svegliati,” he said(wake up). When I move down the passage, I see rags and small tools and other things piled against the wall. I wondered, has the whole of <i class="calibre5">Napoli</i> used this boat for a toilet, and I smelled piss? Animals, pigs in pens have dignity, but where is the dignity here? Two crewmen were leaning against the wall, mostly blocking our way, while they shared a stogie, passing it between them, each taking a single puff. They were laborers, or less, as they had no uniforms. On the street they would be cleaning horseshit, but here, below the line, they were probably important men. We wait for them to finish the precious stogie, and they were in no hurry to move or let us by, as they pretended to work as they smoked. Luca pushed to the front of the line, with me behind him to see he stayed civilized. “Scusa,” he said, but he was ignored, and this caused him to fume with anger. More puffs and long drags, and the passage filled with putrid smoke. The oldest man, and the dirtiest of the two, butts his stogey against the wall and they disappear. I see disappointment on Luca’s face, as they were vile men, deserving of a beating for their disregard. More turns, one left and two right, I think, and we come to a heavy iron door that was closed. We lay our shoulders to the door, but the hinges were dry, like an old bone, sorely in need of oil. Had this door been opened before? We grunted and sweat as we pushed with all we had, but in the end, we had to call for more men and the women stepped aside. The door opens, squealing to wake the dead. I was the first man through; my boot catches the high threshold and I go down. “Why me?” I thought, laying on the floor, while the rest were thinking, “Why not you?” as honest men will do, and they laughed like fools, even the women. How many times have I enjoyed the misfortune of others?  </p>
<p id="page_490" class="calibre6">My pants were split at the crotch and any who looked saw <i class="calibre5">Sparacino</i> few have seen.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was a sad thing, this place we would call home; as bad, or worse, than what we saw on the road, or the ferry, even the train. A solemn room, like funeral parlors I have seen, but without the sweet smell of flowers. The room, itself, maybe, thirty feet long, by eight feet wide, but this is only a guess as I brought no measuring tool. Most everything iron was cold and damp, and slimy. The room was more like a cave, or a long tunnel. At the end, near an inside corner, was another room closed in by a shabby built wooden door, closed and locked with a rusted padlock on a hasp firmly bolted to the iron wall. It was plain to me, this ship was built for cargo, as the ceiling was, maybe, seven foot off the floor, too low for heads, and made of rough cut boards, not tight together, leaving wide spaces for the air to run. The three inside wall were long, also rough cut, like the ceiling. The outside wall was iron and crusted with so many coats of paint, some had peeled and fell to the floor in a pile. Enzo kicks the wall, and a dull echo sounded through the cabin. “We are at the side of the ship,” he said. “Pray these rivets holds, my friends. The indomitable sea is but a few inches away.” It all started closing in on me; I began to sweat, but I figured it was better than sleeping on deck in the cold wind and rain, shitting and pissing over the rail.    </p>
<p id="page_491" class="calibre6">There was an oil lamp in each corner of the cabin, so high off the floor the light cast more to the ceiling, leaving the room dim and dark, but this quiet light was soothing to me, though the smell was sickening, and the ventilation poor. What was painted and not raw, was dark green, the color of the sea, and maybe a better color would have been white, or something near white, and it would not have seemed so much like a cave. Thank God for the oil lamps.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca sticks his nose in the air and sniffed like a dog on a hunt.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Smells like the cattle car,” he says.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was true, the stink overpowered and was sickening at the same time, and we were here less than five minutes. The bad paint and dim lights hid the filth that covered everything. The grit on the floor made noises under foot when you walked. There was like a toilet, thank God, in the room at the end and it surprised me to see such <i class="calibre5">uncivilization</i> (Enzo’s word) on a great iron boat, and I believed other men would listen when I did my business, including women I was not married to, or related to, or acquainted with, and all the children. Like a foolish man, I told myself I could easily hold the rough stuff three or four six days, and that would make it less than three times during the trip. This thought lasted only two days, and now it seems foolish to me.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">A man from the slope of Etna, claimed this was his third trip to America, but on the last voyage the boat was so crowded men were sleeping two in a bed, and we were shocked, but believed him, as he seemed sincere.  Beds I speak of were made of rough-cut lumber, three stories high: the last story a foot from the ceiling, and not suitable for a human being. Woolen blankets were stored in a corner of the room; not piled neatly, or folded, but thrown into a heap and they smelled from where I stood. Each grabbed a blanket, some grabbed two and there seemed to be more than enough, even with those selfish bastards.  There were beds for 30 or 40 people, maybe fifty. I never counted. I never cared.  </p>
<p id="page_492" class="calibre6">“Watch the toilet,” Enzo said, “and pick your spot as far away as possible. The smell will be overpowering.”  This made sense, so we went to the back, and this made sense, so we picked our blankets and threw them down on four lower beds. Luca put a suitcase on the first, his cap on the second, a sweat rag on the third, his ass on the last, and what sane man would challenge him, what with that crazy look on his face?       </p>
<p class="calibre4">Men hung blankets from the ceiling as best they could, and they became like tents, giving the  women and children, some privacy, insuring modesty, except when the boat rocked and  bounded, and the blankets swayed, they would fly, wide open, for all to see. A few of the men  (the <i class="calibre5">cavones</i>) said in private, they enjoyed the rough seas for that reason. In the case of  the young girl, *<i class="calibre5">Assunta</i>, from <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi</i>, picked a bed in the corner and I helped her hang a  blanket from the ceiling and this was to her liking, and she smiled and thanked me, disappearing  into her woolen tent and was the last I saw her the first day. Bags and other luggage were  stored anywhere possible, on the floors, under blankets, or plain in the way. Enzo counted heads;  there were sixteen men, seven women and seven children of ages about four to twelve  years old. He would not calculate the women’s ages, as it was not our business to inquire or  wonder about another man’s wife, or any single women, or any woman for that matter. If I knew  before I bought the ticket, there would be women in the cabin, then, well, I might have given it  more thought. Maybe I would have inquired and sought a boat where the men and women were  separated (if there was one). Probably not. A man, alone, from Catani, complained he would not  share a room with a woman, who was not his wife, his mother or his sister. Luca believed the  complainer had never shared anything with a woman, wife, mother or sister. Enzo touched the  young man’s arm, saying that times will be better, and he should think of women as only smaller  people. I believe he was joking. Enzo had his own complaint, protesting the location of his bed, </p>
<p id="page_493" class="calibre6">that he thought was “too far from the privy,” as he will make the trip  more than once in the night.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Privy? Luca did not know this word. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Privy.” Enzo repeated the word. “In England, among the cultured and influential, it is called the ‘privy.’ I suppose it is a part of their word ‘private.’” Luca laughed, and he kept repeating the word, ‘privy<i class="calibre5">,</i> ’ until it angered Enzo.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do the contadini call it in Sicilia,” he asked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Shithouse,” Luca replied, with no apology for the language, and with women in earshot.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Shithouse? What a very common word, but vulgar. In any case, you will empty your own pot. It is the custom at sea, if it is not a luxury boat…and this is certainly no luxury. I believe in First Class, and maybe Second Class, the pot is graciously emptied by the ships staff. And with 20 or 30 in each cabin, the pot will fill up quickly.” He smiled.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Shithouse? Really.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo checked the cabin. “This pot? Where is it?” Enzo pointed to the room at the end.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Find the tall bucket, or an old wine barrel. When the small pot is filled, you empty it into the bigger pot, and when that is filled, sooner, or later, the crew will throw it overboard…dinner for the fish, as it were.” It is fair that some men might think I am backward, and not civilized because I lived in the hills, but God as my witness, I have not, ever, slept where I shit. Never. Even in the fields, when I worked alone, I walked a hundred feet away. Never in the army. So, I asked, only to be clear, “We do it here, in the cabin?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“That is correct,” Enzo said, with a shrug. “What can we do?”    </p>
<p id="page_494" class="calibre6">Luca took to his blanket and kicked off his boots. “Here, there, what is the difference? Shit is shit.  It all smells, inside or out.”  Enzo shakes his head. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. Not at all. The difference is disease. Worse. Epidemics from disease.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca stretched. “Epidemics?  So? We all die from something. We are men of the world.” He laughed. “World travelers and with it comes risk.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">This will not work. We are sixteen full grown men, seven women and seven children, and this is the same as twenty, or so men. One room? One barrel? One pot? Maybe two pots will work. Are we sure there is only one pot? One pot will not work. Men will fight for the right to be next over the pot. We need another pot, maybe two. Who is the officer is in charge of pots?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">A young sailor, clean looking, with great energy, come into the room and knocked on the wall to get attention. Is he the pot man? He clears his throat and we listen. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We leave port in the hour. The Captain will allow passengers to go on deck, if you so choose, as this may not be possible after tomorrow.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why not,” a man asks.  The sailor stumbles over his words. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Uh, well, it is usually bad weather along the way.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then we are trapped in here two weeks?” The sailor wiped his brow.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, uh, it is better than being swept overboard…there is no chance of rescue.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is this your final answer?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He mumbles under his breath and moves down the line, stopping at every spot, apologizing at the poor privacy, especially to the women. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“On thine line men and women are put in different cabins. But not this ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Someone asks a question I could not hear, but I believe it was “why not?” The sailor acted as if he never heard the question; tipped his cap to the older men and all the women, except the female children.     </p>
<p id="page_495" class="calibre6">“I am sorry,” he said, and I see honest regret on his face. “This is the best we can do. There are easy a thousand, maybe two thousand in third class.” </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Third class? And what is ‘third class,’” a man with a woman and child at his side, asked of the sailor, who was slow to answer. Enzo saw a chance to teach.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They do not like the word ‘steerage,’ Enzo said, putting weight on the word ‘steerage.’ “Third Class” is preferred, as it is less intimidating. But for any word used, we are under water, and you should know it if you do not.” When he says, “under water,” the iron hull split open and the cabin flooded and many died, but not me. A daydream. Enzo took the sailor’s arm, “Tell my friends here…they are nervous…that iron ships rarely sink or have trouble.”  Sailors, as I now understand, do not enjoy talking about catastrophe at sea.  He shifts his weight from one leg to the other, looking for thew right words.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, signuri, to be honest with you…yes, it happens.  God…” Enzo interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “But generally speaking, a ship like this is as safe as, well, walking down the street. Is that not correct?” The sailor nodded.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, of course, signore. In our case, well, we sail with the best captain at sea. There is only a slight chance for a serious accident. My time on this ship has been quiet and safe and I have learned from him.”  Career?  This little pisser spoke well, though he did not look much over twenty. His intentions were honorable. Enzo takes the sailors arm and speaks to the crowd.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My friends, you have heard it from an expert...we are safe, like in the womb.” Enzo patted the sailors back and shook his hand. “I will tell your Captain of the splendid job you have done calming frayed nerves.” The sailor bowed slightly and smiled, thanking Enzo for the kindness, that saying a word to the Captain would be good for a sailor’s career, but he had four more cabins to greet before the ship left port.     </p>
<p id="page_496" class="calibre6">“Before you go. Who is keeper of these pots?” Enzo asked.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The sailor looked confused. “The pots?” He paused and thought. “Oh, you mean the pots in there?” He points to the toilet room.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, in there. We will need more. There must be thirty in this cabin.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Have you looked?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Looked? </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. In the commodes. Each one has a pot. And you fill it, you fill it, you empty it.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ah, si, of course,” Enzo replies. “I did not look…<i class="calibre5">mi dispiace</i>, but I have never been…”        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is that all?” the sailor said, as he turned for the door and started to leave.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca was curled in a ball, like a small child, blanket pulled to his chin, but awake, and following me with his eyes. There was a noise, a sharp noise, from the back of the cabin, but it was nothing, not a crack in the hull, as I worried. When I turned back, Luca was asleep, or he faked sleep to be rid of me. I shook his shoulder.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you going on deck? We might not see home for a long time?” He opens his eyes, slowly, and gave me an odd look.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Home? You say Napoli is home to you? This pig sty of a city?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, not Napoli. Sicilia. Sicilian is in Italia. I am no fool, Luca. I know where I am.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“For me, Antonino, home is where I lay my head,” and he rolls over. Luca was no family man, and he held no special fondness for any woman, but he had many and they liked him, even for his bad eye that drooped, but only when he was tired. How easy he could cast off his old life for a new life, and this was the great difference between us.    </p>
<p id="page_497" class="calibre6">We left Luca with a man and his family, from Ragusa, in Sicilia, and the young girl from Colleberardi, who was holed up in her bed, hidden under two blankets. The man from Ragusa was disappointed, saying he wanted to see his country disappear into the night, but his wife was afraid of crowds, and he refused to leave her alone. When we left, Luca was snoring in rhythm, like a song. If there is a pleasant snore, it is Luca’s snore.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was slow going to the top, as the corridor was packed with people, like cattle moving through the chute to slaughter. We climbed the narrow, iron stairway to the top, but passengers were still loading onto the ship, and the going was tiresome. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Tempers flew, and there was shoving and cursing, but none of it serious.  A family of five, as I counted, worked their way down the stairs, together; two daughters of marrying age, slim, attractive girls, that I would have coveted, if I did not have Carmela waiting for me and then only if they were available. The older girl, very feminine, smiled as she squeezed past me. We rubbed against each other, mio Dio. We rubbed, good, and I worried her father saw it all. Si. I rubbed her, but not on purpose, and I would swear it to the priest, but I am only human. Her father was last in their line and saw it and gave me a dirty look as he cleared his throat. Maybe not in all of Italia, but where I am from, touching a man’s daughter, even innocent, might see your throat cut.  I thought of <i class="calibre5">Enrico Bottino, </i>who was now dead. They say he had his way with <i class="calibre5">Giuseppe Ramadi’s</i> youngest daughter, <i class="calibre5">*Giuseppina.</i>  Enrico, who I called friend, was hanging from a tree in the orchard when we showed up to work, at first light one day. They say he hung himself rather than face her father. This played on my mind until the family passed, but their father turned and stared at me, pointing to his eyes. I near shit my pants.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">The air in the corridor smelled poisoned and I blame the goddamned smokers; stogie smokers, cigarettes smokers, and god damn them all, these people who live for no reason but to blow smoke in my face and make me sick. The old man behind me chewed on a long cigar, the tip so close to my neck I felt its heat. Did it stop him? Did he give a shit? I coughed, more than once and he smiled and wanted to talk. What did these sonofabitchs care?  Hell was in their future, where every dead smoker blows smoke in his own face for all eternity. Thank God my friends do not smoke, and this may be our strongest bond, the reason we are friends, that we hate men who smoke (except relatives, who are allowed this <i class="calibre5">cattivo)</i>. Maybe I will have a cigar after Sunday dinner, with my father, my grandfather; no more than one and at no other time. At the top of the stairs, the breeze was cool, almost chilly, and the air thinned and easier to breathe.  </p>
<p id="page_498" class="calibre6">“No reason to push,” I hear someone say. “Make room along the railing…give everyone a chance to see.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">We come onto the deck near the middle of the ship, but the twists and turns confused me, and I could not tell which side the right side was to see <i class="calibre5">Napoli</i>.  It was a crowded deck, a few hundred I thought, but Enzo claimed more than five hundred, maybe a thousand. Not friends, but no longer strangers, because we shared the same journey to the same end, and the same fate should there be trouble. One goes down, we all go down, and it was a good feeling. Third class?  Second Class? First class? Dead is dead. We are all in the same boat, and strangers become good friends.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Lights strung on high poles lit the deck, but they were poorly placed, casting deep shadows when clouds covered the moon, that in itself was full and crisp, easily lighting the city of Napoli, and the moon shadows were dark and light at the same time, like life in a dream.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Stai attento</i>, my friend.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Who said it? The voice startled me, but soon enough, thank God, to keep me from falling into a hole near twenty feet deep. Some cavone left open a gate he was supposed to close. I look around for my savior, but close enough to touch was a hundred men and none stood out from the crowd, or took credit for saving my life.      </p>
<p id="page_499" class="calibre6">The rules we live by did not count for much that night, as men elbowed women off the railing, big children pulled small children away, while parents looked the other way. The bullies were wild and out of control (if they are ever in control) until a sailor, a rough looker, I am glad to say, yelled his rules to a crowd. “No pushing…no shoving…no climbing, or else,” and his yell was more a bellow, like an infantry sergeant and he made no apology for this crudeness. A father pulled his two aggressive boys away from the railing, and lectured them on manners, as he checked the sailor on the sly. The older boy was a fit youngster, maybe ten, but he went back to the rail, and put one leg over, until his papa dragged him away again, but he broke free and ran to his mother who covered him with her shawl, against the cold night ai, or a beating from his angry father. There was a ruckus in the middle of the crowd; a mother screamed, as she had lost sight of her child, a son, and imagined the worst, that he fell overboard and was drowned. Dead. A few passengers joined her family in the search, and two fit men walked the rail, checking the sea, calling out the boy’s name, “Andrea, Andrea.” Happily, the boy was found wandering at the back of the ship, ignorant that his mother went through hell on his behalf. The three men, who had joined the search and left the rail, lost their good spots; Enzo said it was a shameful thing we did, with no regard for the child, yet he took one of the spots, and admired the view of Napoli.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I could feel the engines and in a few minutes, they began to turn faster and louder, laboring against the pull of the tide, as sailors walked the deck loosening the ropes that held us to the dock. We gazed at the city in the distance, covered in a glow, like an orange fog. Somewhere to the south, I thought a thousand miles away, was our country, Sicilia, not Napoli, not Italia. Years later I hear the distance was nowhere near what I thought.    </p>
<p id="page_500" class="calibre6">Now the deck shook, more a rattle; my feet and legs vibrated, and it felt good, soothing. The engines churned white circles of foam off the side of the boat. I ask Enzo what wisdom did he have for this moment?  “<i class="calibre5">Niente</i>,” he said, starring off at Napoli.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">They pressed at our backs, the men and women with no place on the railing, but I pushed back, refusing to be a gentleman. Enough of being a gentleman.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo stared across the horizon, at the lights of the city. “They are beautiful when they sparkle, like stars.”  Enzo cleared his throat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, my friend. It looks like they are sparkling.” He smiled. “But it is the dust in the air playing tricks on the eyes. Nothing more. The light does not actually sparkle, or twinkle as some say.” Forever after that day, I wished he said nothing; never again did I enjoy the beauty of what I imagined to be magical. I changed the subject before he destroyed more of what were my dreams. More important to me than lights, was this man, himself. Why is he here, with us? He is educated. A teacher (if he was). I wanted to ask him straight out. Was he running from the cops? Maybe a woman? Another man’s wife? Did he owe to the Black Hand? And how much? </p>
<p class="calibre6">My balls. Where were they? Do I feel for them, in front of five hundred? </p>
<p class="calibre6">I will ask another time.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A husky sailor, with a thick, black beard, pushed his way to the railing. “Move aside.” We separated and let him pass. He loosened the ropes holding the ship and dropped them to a sailor on the dock. Enzo patted my shoulder and smiled, and I smiled back, like old friends, but were not.  “There is no turning back,” Enzo said. “What we find will be our future. What  we leave is our past, and dead.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I felt a chill. I should have asked. Mama and papa? Were they my past?   </p>
<p id="page_501" class="calibre6">The engines struggled hard, the deck vibrated, and the boat felt as if it was falling apart. A frightened young woman grabbed at the rail.  “Are we sinking?” she asks Enzo.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, signora, the engines are turning over…perfectly normal,” and she believed him and thanked him, but her hands turned white from her tight grip on the rail.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">Somewhere near the middle of the ship, I hear this beautiful music, that was pure and clean, as it floated through the heavy night air. Neither the rattle of the engines, or the sounds of the sea, could kill it, or did the people, or the wind.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">I ask Enzo, “the music…who is singing?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A priest,” he said, without emotion. “And a <i class="calibre5">Scalabrinan</i>, I believe.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Scalabrinan</i>? I have not heard of them. Are they Catholic?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, of course. They help Italiani immigrants in America. You and me, my friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I abandon my good spot at the railing and wandered toward the crowd, looking for this man who sang beautiful music, as just hearing him was not enough. I wanted to see his face and hold his hand and ask for his blessing. Enzo followed, but not Santo, who has said music is of no interest to him.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He sings in Latin,” Enzo said, pointing to the priest. “German music. Franz Shubert’s <i class="calibre5">Ave Maria. </i>He sings like an inspired man…as beautiful as I have heard it sung…better than any German could sing it.” There were tears in Enzo’s eyes, and I turned away, pretending not to see. But I cried, too, and felt no shame.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">So, it is called the<i class="calibre5"> Ave Maria. </i>I have heard it before, in the <i class="calibre5">Chiesa di Sant’Agatha</i>. I believe it was sung by <i class="calibre5">Giuseppina Spucci</i>, the wife of <i class="calibre5">Andrea Battaglia</i>; she sang it well, but not powerful, like this priest, and she could not make me cry, like a woman. A crowd pressed close around him, listening;  no one moved or made a sound, not even the children who obeyed and did not stir. We were all sad at leaving home, except the children who did not seem to understand, but they cried if their family cried, and all the women cried, but only a few of the men, and me. I turned away that no one could see, though I would not have been ashamed if they did.      </p>
<p id="page_502" class="calibre6">“He praises the Blessed Virgin,” Enzo said. “He asks her blessing for all of us, even heathens, if there are any on the boat. Listen to the music, my friend. You will feel better...you will lose your fear of what is coming.”  For the moment, at least, his music calmed my fear and soothed my sadness at leaving home. It would not be honest to say I felt good about it, but soothed.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">He was a tall priest and a fine-looking young man; he stood alone, his black robe cracking in the wind, and he held a book in both hands. I am sure the women in his parish were sad he has been sent to America, that he would no longer watch over their souls. His voice had great power and was overwhelming, and most wept while he sang, and he sung until the ship was free of the currents and away. In the end, when he had finished, I swear I could hear his music echoing across the winds. He walked through the crowd of the faithful, and they parted, and at that moment we were all faithful, and he gave his blessing to all. I knelt in front of him, asking that he pray for my family who I left in Sicilia on their own. He would remember them in his prayers, he said, kissing a small cloth he held tightly in his hand, then touched it to my forehead and I felt a shiver in my arms.   </p>
