<h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px; font-style: italic;">The Gangplank, the Lie, and Steerage</h1>

<div class="chapter-body">

    <p>The gangplank was wide and solid and did not move, or bounce, like the plank on the ferry, but it was a hard climb, more like a steep hill with rocks, and my legs burned when I reached the top. I stepped aside to let others pass, as I took my last look at <em>Italia</em>. How painful it was to see her for the last time.</p>
    <p>This is when I saw her, the young girl from <em>Colleberardi</em>, struggling with her suitcase, dragging it up the steep plank. She smiled and stopped, as if there was a question, but she asked nothing of me and moved on. I leaned on the railing, searching across the wharf, and I saw them through the dim light, the <em>D’arrico’s</em>, <em>Emil</em> pacing in front of the bench. <em>Luca</em> stopped and watched, and <em>Santo</em> shouted to them, but the wind was strong, carrying the sound out to sea.</p>
    <p>“What are they doing?” <em>Santo</em> asked, as if I should know. I thought to lie, for no reason but to save <em>Emil’s</em> reputation, but we would never meet again, so what did it matter? “<em>Emil</em> lost their tickets. He has no money after paying off the priest. He asked for a loan. I said no.” <em>Luca</em> scoffed every time I mentioned <em>Emil’s</em> name. He hated him, for no other reason, I believe, than <em>Emil</em> had <em>Amaria</em>, and <em>Luca</em> did not. He seemed to enjoy the family’s misfortune.</p>
    <p>“Lost the tickets? A fool loses his tickets,” he said. <em>Enzo</em> squeezed onto the rail. “Who are these people we are staring at? Friends?”</p>
    <p>“They are friends,” I said. “But they have not been friends for long. Only a few days. They are good and decent people. The wife, <em>Amaria</em>, is a charitable woman, but her decency has sunk them all.”</p>
    <p><em>Luca</em> stood with his back to the dock, “Charity is the pastime of fools,” he said. “Good riddance to the whole family.” He did not mean it, since it was clear to all he plainly coveted <em>Amaria</em> from the second we met. <em>Enzo</em> was sorry for their difficulty, he said, “but what fool puts a stranger over family? These words made <em>Enzo</em> uncomfortable, as I could tell.</p>
    <p>“<em>Luca</em>, have you heard the priest say, ‘charity covers a multitude of sin?’” “Of course, I have. Am I a barbarian? But always take care of number one.”</p>
    <p><em>Enzo</em> looked frustrated to me, maybe realizing he was speaking to a stone wall. He looked again to the <em>D’Arrico’s</em>, who were still on the dock.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Missed Chance</h3>

    <p>“<em>Antonino</em>. If they are your friends, I would gladly lend them a little money. If you speak for them, then I trust they would pay it back.” I turned and took <em>Enzo</em> by the arm. “You have money to lend?” “<em>Si</em>. A little. Not much. I have saved for a long time.”</p>
    <p>Hundreds were coming came up the gangplank, hordes of people, like the rich woman said. How do I get past them on the way down? I should have asked <em>Enzo</em> in the first place if he had money to lend, bur we barely know him. He went to his poke and handed me fifty <em>lire</em>, enough to buy tickets for the family. I fought my way to the railing and called out to <em>Emil</em>, but the noise from the wharf was like a wall. I shout again, and I thought maybe he heard me, when I see him move, but they started walking toward the city. I ran back along the railing like a crazy man, yelling his name. “<em>Emil</em>…<em>Emil</em>,” until I hit the gangplank; a man shoved me, saying I was “<em>pazzo</em>,” as he pushed me away. <em>Emil</em> looked back toward the gangplank, and I was sure he heard me call. I waved wildly, yelling his name, but he turned away and they went lost in the crowd. I push my way halfway down the gangplank, where a cop grabbed my arm.</p>
    <p>“If you leave you cannot return,” he said. I stopped. My feet anchored to the plank. What do I do, I ask myself?</p>
    <p>I did what any decent man would do. I went back and found <em>Enzo</em> and returned his fifty <em>lire</em>, thanked him and said the money was no longer needed. I knew I would never see these people again; at that moment I promised <em>Emil</em>, in spirit, anyway, I would pray for him and his family, that they would be safe and prosper wherever they went. <em>Enzo</em> stuffs the fifty into a pocket. “It is ironic how life takes its turns, some good, some bad,” he said. Ironic? What did this word mean? I did not ask him to explain.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Manifest Confusion</h3>

    <p>The wind came from <em>Napoli</em> city, full and cold and steady, sometimes furious. Women held their hats, but a few ended in the sea and the women all said the same thing, it was her best hat, and it would be missed. One woman, I recall, cried, no, she wept, and her husband put his arm around her shoulder, promising he would buy her another in America, and she smiled. The line moved, slow and monotonous, like all lines, even the fastest lines. A short, stub of a man, an official looking man, a ledger tucked under his right arm, forced his way through the line. His bearing was proper, like an officer, and when he turned quick, he caught staring at him and I was embarrassed</p>
    <p><em>Enzo</em> stood tight at my side, too close for a man to be, so I nudge him back. “Your friends? What do they think of me?” he asked. “You are welcome to travel with us, but you are on your own.”</p>
    <p>He was happy with this and smiled. “But what do they think of me? Have they said?” “We forgive you for not being <em>Siclianu</em>.” He laughed, thinking it a joke, but no, it was not. “If you cause us any trouble, well, you will have to deal with <em>Luca</em>. Not me.” “Trouble? No, of course not. I respect that you have told me the truth.”</p>
    <p>Near the door to Third Class (steerage) was the officer who broke through the line, and I see his uniform was well-tailored, shaped to his body, though he was a short and stubby man. But clean shaven. Odd thing, I thought, it is late, near midnight and he looked too good for a night detail. A clean shave is Church on Sunday, even for an officer. He was checking names off the manifest; when my turn came, I took two steps forward.</p>
    <p>“Name?” he said, still looking in his manifest book.</p>
    <p>“<em>Antonino Sparacino</em>,” I said it proudly, but as he ignored me and flipped through the pages of his book, I smelled the shit that was coming my way.</p>
    <p>“<em>Vediamo</em>,” he says, slowly, as his eyes (that were too close together) check up and down the manifest. “I have a <em>Sporino</em>, from <em>Montepalgano</em>, but he is <em>Giuseppe</em>, not <em>Antonino</em>.” He squinted in the poor light. “This is the ‘<em>Antonio Lopez</em>. Are you on the right ship? Are you confused?” He pointed to another ship in the harbor. “She is the <em>Victor Emmanuel</em>, leaving for Argentina in the morning. Maybe you are on that ship?”</p>
    <p>“No, <em>signuri</em>, I am on the right boat.” I stayed calm, neither angry or excited, as maybe he did not hear me good. “Not <em>Sporino</em>. I am <em>Sparacino</em>.” He nodded and looked again, but I think he just flipped pages, not too concerned if I was there, or not.</p>
    <p>“<em>Sparacino</em>? Are you sure it is not <em>Sporino</em>, and he proceeded to spell it? S-p-o-r-i-n-o.” The goddamned fool.</p>
    <p>“It has been ‘<em>Sparacino</em>’ for a thousand years, as I know. Maybe longer. My father is <em>Orazio</em>, and his father is <em>Antonino</em>, and I am named for him. We are <em>Sparacino</em>. I am <em>Sparacino</em>.” The line behind was restless, except for <em>Luca</em> and <em>Santo</em> and <em>Enzo</em>, who are friends, but I hear clear calls from the rest, who were not friends, that I should step aside. I could see the officer was getting impatient, and I would certainly lose.</p>
    <p>“<em>Mi dispiace</em>, but you are not here. I mean you are not on the manifest. I cannot let you board. You are on the wrong ship…that is easy if you are not….”</p>
    <p><em>Enzo</em> pushed me aside. “Please, <em>signore</em>,” he says to the officer, but respectfully. “May I see the manifest?” and in seconds he finds the error, when the officer could not. “Here it is.” He points to a line on the sheet. “<em>Sparacino</em> is with an ‘S,’ but you have filed my friend under the “F’s’ after ‘<em>Francino</em>.’ Your clerical staff simply confused the letters, that’s all.” The officer apologized to <em>Enzo</em>, and thanked him for finding the error, but declared, for certain he would have found it, sooner or later. He said nothing to me. <em>Niente</em>. Nothing, I was invisible and not there.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Scent of Steerage</h3>

    <p>“Regrettably” he said, my purser has poor penmanship.” He grabbed my ticket and wrote on it “Deck S– Section A.” I give him my hand to shake, but he ignored it, staring over my shoulder to the rest of the line. “Next,” he said. No matter. He was not an important man, like the captain, or the man who runs the pump, if there is a pump. He played with the paper he held, like a child plays with blocks, shuffling them from one pile to another. Of what use is he, except in his own mind? He cleared his throat. “Follow the line to deck S,” he said. “Do not stop in the corridors. You must keep the line moving.” I nodded and stepped out to wait for the others; <em>Luca</em> and <em>Enzo</em> passed through fine, as did <em>Santo</em> once he found his ticket, that he had hidden in his left boot for safe keeping. We follow the line, making many turns, then finally through a heavy metal door, that closed on its own, but two sailors held it open. Down a narrow iron stairway, with wooden treads that were wet and slippery and foul looking as if someone spilt a pail of grease on the treads. Painted on a wall at the bottom of the first landing, or second landing, I forget, was a bold, red line with two arrows drawn from it, one pointing to the ceiling, the other down, toward the floor.</p>
    <p>“Someone has made a joke of the water line,” <em>Enzo</em> said. I saw it. Who needed twenty years of school to know what it meant? I edged my way to the wall, and I see my nose was just above the line, but not so <em>Santo</em>, and when he asked what it was, <em>Enzo</em> blamed some fool with a paint brush, and nothing better to do.</p>
    <p>The passage was a narrow way, barely room for big man to walk, or two small men, and the walls seemed to move and close on me and I thought of grapes in a wine press. The down there was wetter and fouler than the air one deck up. A tall man was stooping, for no other reason than he could not stand erect, and he appeared nervous and unsettled and all of a sudden, he yells that he could not take it anymore, and pushed his way back to the stairs. I thought, was he the first victim of this journey; he was, unless the <em>D’arrico’s</em> are counted, or the woman on the dock. I thought more on it and put him six, as the woman on the gangplank was certainly dead, God rest her soul, and the <em>D’arrico’s</em> were friends. A man nudges me from behind. “<em>Svegliati</em>,” he said (wake up). When I move down the passage, I see rags and small tools and other things piled against the wall. I wondered, has the whole of <em>Napoli</em> used this boat for a toilet, and I smelled piss? Animals, pigs in pens have dignity, but where is the dignity here? Two crewmen were leaning against the wall, mostly blocking our way, while they shared a <em>stogie</em>, passing it between them, each taking a single puff. They were laborers, or less, as they had no uniforms. On the street they would be cleaning horseshit, but here, below the line, they were probably important men. We wait for them to finish the precious <em>stogie</em>, and they were in no hurry to move or let us by, as they pretended to work as they smoked. <em>Luca</em> pushed to the front of the line, with me behind him to see he stayed civilized. “<em>Scusa</em>,” he said, but he was ignored, and this caused him to fume with anger. More puffs and long drags, and the passage filled with putrid smoke.</p>
    <p>The oldest man, and the dirtiest of the two, butts his <em>stogey</em> against the wall and they disappear. I see disappointment on <em>Luca’s</em> face, as they were vile men, deserving of a beating for their disregard. More turns, one left and two right, I think, and we come to a heavy iron door that was closed. We lay our shoulders to the door, but the hinges were dry, like an old bone, sorely in need of oil. Had this door been opened before? We grunted and sweat as we pushed with all we had, but in the end, we had to call for more men and the women stepped aside. The door opens, squealing to wake the dead. I was the first man through; my boot catches the high threshold and I go down. “Why me?” I thought, laying on the floor, while the rest were thinking, “Why not you?” as honest men will do, and they laughed like fools, even the women. How many times have I enjoyed the misfortune of others?</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Cabin of the Condemned</h3>

    <p>My pants were split at the crotch and any who looked saw <em>Sparacino</em> few have seen. It was a sad thing, this place we would call home; as bad, or worse, than what we saw on the road, or the ferry, even the train. A solemn room, like funeral parlors I have seen, but without the sweet smell of flowers. The room, itself, maybe, thirty feet long, by eight feet wide, but this is only a guess as I brought no measuring tool. Most everything iron was cold and damp, and slimy. The room was more like a cave, or a long tunnel. At the end, near an inside corner, was another room closed in by a shabby built wooden door, closed and locked with a rusted padlock on a hasp firmly bolted to the iron wall. It was plain to me, this ship was built for cargo, as the ceiling was, maybe, seven foot off the floor, too low for heads, and made of rough cut boards, not tight together, leaving wide spaces for the air to run. The three inside wall were long, also rough cut, like the ceiling. The outside wall was iron and crusted with so many coats of paint, some had peeled and fell to the floor in a pile. <em>Enzo</em> kicks the wall, and a dull echo sounded through the cabin. “We are at the side of the ship,” he said. “Pray these rivets holds, my friends. The indomitable sea is but a few inches away.” It all started closing in on me; I began to sweat, but I figured it was better than sleeping on deck in the cold wind and rain, shitting and pissing over the rail.</p>
    <p>There was an oil lamp in each corner of the cabin, so high off the floor the light cast more to the ceiling, leaving the room dim and dark, but this quiet light was soothing to me, though the smell was sickening, and the ventilation poor. What was painted and not raw, was dark green, the color of the sea, and maybe a better color would have been white, or something near white, and it would not have seemed so much like a cave. Thank God for the oil lamps. <em>Luca</em> sticks his nose in the air and sniffed like a dog on a hunt. “Smells like the cattle car,” he says. It was true, the stink overpowered and was sickening at the same time, and we were here less than five minutes. The bad paint and dim lights hid the filth that covered everything. The grit on the floor made noises under foot when you walked. There was like a toilet, thank God, in the room at the end and it surprised me to see such uncivilization (<em>Enzo’s</em> word) on a great iron boat, and I believed other men would listen when I did my business, including women I was not married to, or related to, or acquainted with, and all the children. Like a foolish man, I told myself I could easily hold the rough stuff three or four six days, and that would make it less than three times during the trip. This thought lasted only two days, and now it seems foolish to me.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Question of the Pots</h3>

    <p>A man from the slope of <em>Etna</em>, claimed this was his third trip to America, but on the last voyage the boat was so crowded men were sleeping two in a bed, and we were shocked, but believed him, as he seemed sincere. Beds I speak of were made of rough-cut lumber, three stories high: the last story a foot from the ceiling, and not suitable for a human being. Woolen blankets were stored in a corner of the room; not piled neatly, or folded, but thrown into a heap and they smelled from where I stood. Each grabbed a blanket, some grabbed two and there seemed to be more than enough, even with those selfish bastards. There were beds for 30 or 40 people, maybe fifty. I never counted. I never cared.</p>
    <p>“Watch the toilet,” <em>Enzo</em> said, “and pick your spot as far away as possible. The smell will be overpowering.” This made sense, so we went to the back, and this made sense, so we picked our blankets and threw them down on four lower beds. <em>Luca</em> put a suitcase on the first, his cap on the second, a sweat rag on the third, his ass on the last, and what sane man would challenge him, what with that crazy look on his face? Men hung blankets from the ceiling as best they could, and they became like tents, giving the women and children, some privacy, insuring modesty, except when the boat rocked and bounded, and the blankets swayed, they would fly, wide open, for all to see. A few of the men (the <em>cavones</em>) said in private, they enjoyed the rough seas for that reason. In the case of the young girl, <em>Assunta</em>, from <em>Colleberardi</em>, picked a bed in the corner and I helped her hang a blanket from the ceiling and this was to her liking, and she smiled and thanked me, disappearing into her woolen tent and was the last I saw her the first day. Bags and other luggage were stored anywhere possible, on the floors, under blankets, or plain in the way. <em>Enzo</em> counted heads; there were sixteen men, seven women and seven children of ages about four to twelve years old. He would not calculate the women’s ages, as it was not our business to inquire or wonder about another man’s wife, or any single women, or any woman for that matter. If I knew before I bought the ticket, there would be women in the cabin, then, well, I might have given it more thought. Maybe I would have inquired and sought a boat where the men and women were separated (if there was one). Probably not. A man, alone, from *Catani, complained he would not share a room with a woman, who was not his wife, his mother or his sister. <em>Luca</em> believed the complainer had never shared anything with a woman, wife, mother or sister. <em>Enzo</em> touched the young man’s arm, saying that times will be better, and he should think of women as only smaller people. I believe he was joking. <em>Enzo</em> had his own complaint, protesting the location of his bed, that he thought was “too far from the privy,” as he will make the trip more than once in the night.</p>
    <p>Privy? <em>Luca</em> did not know this word. “Privy.” <em>Enzo</em> repeated the word. “In England, among the cultured and influential, it is called the ‘privy.’ I suppose it is a part of their word ‘private.’” <em>Luca</em> laughed, and he kept repeating the word, ‘privy,’ until it angered <em>Enzo</em>. “What do the <em>contadini</em> call it in <em>Sicilia</em>,” he asked. “<em>Shithouse</em>,” <em>Luca</em> replied, with no apology for the language, and with women in earshot. “<em>Shithouse</em>? What a very common word, but vulgar. In any case, you will empty your own pot. It is the custom at sea, if it is not a luxury boat…and this is certainly no luxury. I believe in First Class, and maybe Second Class, the pot is graciously emptied by the ships staff. And with 20 or 30 in each cabin, the pot will fill up quickly.” He smiled. “<em>Shithouse</em>? Really.”</p>
    <p><em>Santo</em> checked the cabin. “This pot? Where is it?” <em>Enzo</em> pointed to the room at the end. “Find the tall bucket, or an old wine barrel. When the small pot is filled, you empty it into the bigger pot, and when that is filled, sooner, or later, the crew will throw it overboard…dinner for the fish, as it were.” It is fair that some men might think I am backward, and not civilized because I lived in the hills, but God as my witness, I have not, ever, slept where I shit. Never. Even in the fields, when I worked alone, I walked a hundred feet away. Never in the army. So, I asked, only to be clear, “We do it here, in the cabin?”</p>
    <p>“That is correct,” <em>Enzo</em> said, with a shrug. “What can we do?”</p>
    <p><em>Luca</em> took to his blanket and kicked off his boots. “Here, there, what is the difference? Shit is shit. It all smells, inside or out.” <em>Enzo</em> shakes his head. “No. Not at all. The difference is disease. Worse. Epidemics from disease.”</p>
    <p><em>Luca</em> stretched. “Epidemics? So? We all die from something. We are men of the world.” He laughed. “World travelers and with it comes risk.”</p>
    <p>This will not work. We are sixteen full grown men, seven women and seven children, and this is the same as twenty, or so men. One room? One barrel? One pot? Maybe two pots will work. Are we sure there is only one pot? One pot will not work. Men will fight for the right to be next over the pot. We need another pot, maybe two. Who is the officer is in charge of pots?</p>
