<!-- The Ferry Tailor
On the rough ferry ride, Antonino meets a tailor, Emil D’Arrico, and his family, also heading to America for work.
-->
<div class="chapter-body">

<p class="calibre6">The ferry jumps hard, without warning, and pulled from the dock, and anyone standing stumbled, and a few fell to the floor. Santo clawed at the side of his bench for something to grab but peeling paint that came off in strips and small pieces. The air was thick and dirty, the  burning fuel made me sick. A changing wind pushed black smoke through the open windows, we were forbidden to close. The current tossed the ferry, like nothing, and the tired engines turned, fighting for power to pull free into the strait.  The ferry turned east to Villa San Giovanni. The Carribieneri did not stop us, but they could deny the ferry the right to dock at Villa San Giovanni or stop our boat in Napoli and send us back home, like beaten dogs, It will not be over until I step my right foot in America and lose myself and cannot be found until I want to be found. If I think like a criminal, it is their fault. </p>
<p class="calibre6">The cabin was quiet, but not calm; the only noise above the engine noise, was the noise of nervous men and nervous women and scared children, struggling to breathe the smoke and fumes. The children cried. All of them cried and this I understood.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Across the aisle, no more than two feet away, sat a good-looking family of four people; they stared ahead, and none move a muscle, like statues in the piazza. The girl child leaned against her mother’s shoulder, and the boy, maybe ten years old, sat with his father, who looked worn out and too old to have young children. The boy asked why they were on the ferry, and the father, while looking straight ahead, and with no emotion, said “to eat.” He knew I was looking and listening, when he turned to me, apologizing for his children.            </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This is strange to them. They are frightened.” I nod, politely, but turned away as I did not wish to meet a stranger, but he insisted and kept talking.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Excuse my manners,” he said, “As poor as they are.” He introduced himself.   </p>
<p id="page_364" class="calibre6">“I am *Emil D’Arrico, from Casamara, near Palermu. Have you heard of it?” He leaned across the narrow aisle and extended his small, femminile (feminine) hand, that was wet. Very wet. His voice was low and soft, again femminile, like his hands, but I believed he was a respectable man, and his clothes were decent, and he was neat and clean.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sparacino,” I said. “Antonino,” and he nodded. “From Ali’ Superiore. Me and my friend, Luca Ponto. My cousin, Santo Sparacino.” They barely nodded.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Piacere,” he said, wiping both palms across his jacket.          </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This is my wife,” he said, and I see he was proud of her.  “*Amaria Mastrianno.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">She nodded, politely, like gentle women do. <i class="calibre5">Mio Diu</i>, I thought, she is too beautiful to be a man’s wife, and younger than him by fifteen, <i class="calibre5">maybe</i> twenty years. He is probably wealthy, or why would she marry a man old enough to be her father?  I marveled at her beauty, her skin, how smooth and young, not a wrinkle or a line, not a single blemish and her eyes were bright and clean. At another time, I might have fallen for her, acted like a fool, babbling when I spoke, but now I have Carmela; those days are behind me.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Piacere</i>, it is a pleasure to meet you,” I said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">My good God, how beautiful she is, but I said this to myself, three or four times. My God, she is beautiful.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He introduced his children. *Agatina and Giovanni D’Arrico. The boy resembled his father, and his features were good, strong Siclianu, but his frame was small, and taking it altogether I judged him to be a frail, maybe sickly boy. The girl, like her mother, was beautiful, though I do not believe this is the right word when speaking of a child so young. It was almost vulgar. But like her mother, she was more Greek, than Siclianu. No disrespect to Signor D’Arrico, but at first, I did think he was a hardworking man, with his fair skin and no burn as I could see, not even on his hands or neck. Maybe a shoemaker or a clerk. Good trades, but these men are white and sickly, not hardy, with a deep burn, like farm men. His wife was a shy woman, I see, sitting quiet, hands folded on her lap, never speaking unless asked a question, and to some men, this simple quality would make her a fine Sicilian wife; a woman to honor and bring to the piazza on Sunday, after church. Where was Casamara, I wondered.          </p>
<p id="page_365" class="calibre6">“Casamara? Where does it lay from Palermu?” Emil scratched behind his ear, as he stared at the cabin wall.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ah, thirty miles, or so, south,” he said, drawing a map in the air with his pointing finger.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He laughed. “In the mountains. But we all live on some mountain. And you three?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are near Aetna.” He curled his lips and nodded.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Etna? They say it is a beautiful mountain. I have never …”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The ferry jumped hard, and I believed we hit a wave in the Straits, head on, but not big enough to sink us, thank God.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is it always this rough?” he asked, a little shaken, as I could tell. He was breathing hard and grabbed hold of the seat, and his family seeing this, did the same, though his children did not seem frightened.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Morning in the Strait is like a bad road,” I said. “I was here in the army years back.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The army? I never served,” he said. “My health.” Emil smiled at his wife, who held her daughter’s hand. “I hope we make it to the other side. We are, uh, going to Napoli.” He paused, took a deep breath and rubbed his chest. “Then to meet my brother, *Michele D’Arrico. He lives in Brukland. America. There is plenty of work in his shop, he says.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“That is good to hear. What do you do, uh, for a living, if I may ask?” </p>
<p id="page_366" class="calibre6">He pinched his jacket sleeve, “a tailor,” and he said it proudly, as if to be a tailor was like being <i class="calibre5">Il Papa.</i>  “And my brother is a tailor, but a better tailor than I am, or will ever be. He works at a shop with twelve other tailors. Near a great iron bridge. I have never seen an iron bridge, signuri. Have you?”  I thought. Wood bridges I have seen. Never iron. No. Never.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“An iron bridge? Never. It will be a sight to see. In Brukland, you say?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, in Brukland. Yes, it will be a sight,” and he settled back. “We will work together for the first time. Of course, we will be thousands of miles from home, and I do not want to leave, but what is left in Sicilia for a man with my skills.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A skilled tailor and you have no work?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Some work,” he said. “But they beat you down until you work for nothing and say what a goddamn favor they are doing for you.” He glanced at his wife, who was shaking her head, and this caused him to apologize for his course language. He leaned and touched my knee, that surprised me, as I did not know this man. “The whole of Sicilia is out of work,” he said. “If you do not work, then you cannot afford to buy clothes, and what use do you have for a tailor, if you have no clothes?  A man must eat, but he can live without a suit. Do not misunderstand me, Signuri, I live for my work. I learned my trade at my father’s knee, and he learned from his father. But I have a family to support. Me, alone? I would die in Sicilia.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He hugged his son. They smiled together.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Children deserve a better life than their parents,” he said. “Do you have children?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. I am not married,” and just these simple words made me feel inferior, that no woman wanted me. Did I have prospects, he asked? A man must have prospects.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, there is a young woman, and I am certain we will marry when I return.”  </p>
<p id="page_367" class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Bene</i>,” he said. “<i class="calibre5">Bene</i>. Only family is important. And maybe your health. Nothing else. You are lucky. Still a young man.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“When did your brother leave Sicilia?” I asked, for no reason but to change the subject, as I did not enjoy personal questions from strangers.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He turns to his wife. “Three years ago. That is correct? He left Casamara with his family before the new year.” His wife leaned to him and whispered. “Si. Yes. My wife reminds me. It was Christmas Day. A bad time for our family. His youngest child, *Alfonzo, is sickly and we offered to keep him, but my brother refused. He would not break up his family.” He cleared his throat and sighed, heavy.  “When they walked down the road and disappeared, imagine what I felt. No news for months…we thought the worst, of course. Our mother, God rest her soul,” and he made the sign of the cross, “she prayed every day. Are they dead or alive? The worst was not knowing.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The brightness of the morning sun cast a wide path of sparkling light across the strait, that spread from east to west, blinding if you looked straight on. I hear a child say he was sick from the smell, and his mother answered, “we are almost there,” and she rubbed the child’s head. We stopped dead in the water, a strange feeling; not here, or there, but in the middle, bobbing like that cork in a water barrel, but I have already said it.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">We  stayed calm, thank God, and Emil talked on.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“One day a letter came, three pages long. Two months from America to Sicilia and another month to <i class="calibre5">Casamara</i>. I opened it and looked at it, and ran like a crazy man to *Patri Pietro, so excited I slipped on loose stone in the Piazza, and the old men laughed when I fell on my…my back. A letter from my brother. I knew he was alive.” This I did not understand, that a man who spoke so well would need the priest to read for him. </p>
<p id="page_368" class="calibre6">“Your words…you talk like an educated man. Why did you need the priest?” But his wife defended her husband.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My husband <i class="calibre5">is</i> an educated man,” she said, but realized what she had done, and covered her mouth and for her rudeness, as she called it. I respected what she did.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil took her hand, rubbing gently, smiling. “I do read and write,” he said, “But only Sicilianu. The letter was in some dialect from the north, written by a friend of my brother. So, I took it to Patri Pietro, an educated man from Roma, who reads and writes dialects.” Santo leaned into the conversation, but he stopped and backed away.  “<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiace</i>,” he said, waving his hand. “This is not my business.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Nonsense,” Emil said. “Please. Your question?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, uh, the sea trip?  Did your brother say how long it took to cross?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil shifted his feet under the long bench. “More than three weeks, I am sorry to say, and the sea was rough and rolling every day. He complained the waves beat all night against the hull and it was frightening. He was near crazy because he could not sleep, fearing the boat would sink.”  Santo leaned across me to speak with Emil; it was an annoying thing he did, and I gave him a dirty look, but he would not back off.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We hear there is violence on these ships. Did your brother tell of trouble?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, there <i class="calibre5">was</i> trouble. A rough crew and a bad Captain, who could not control his men. Some <i class="calibre5">ubriaco</i>, a drunk sailor made indecent remarks to a woman, in front of her children. He offered to pay her for,” he paused and looked at his wife. “Well, you understand the rest. When she told her husband, I believe his name was Emiliano, he was enraged, and found the sailor and attacked him with a club, doing some damage to his head, but not fatal. This Emiliano was thrown in the jail and when his brothers tried to break him out there was a battle and some men were injured. My brother did not fight, thank God, but his wife, my cognata, was terrified for her children. She refused to leave the cabin for the rest of the trip. And when my brother, a <i class="calibre5">pazze,</i> landed in America…he is too honest…he admitted being broke, <i class="calibre5">indigente</i>, so he was not let in until someone spoke for him. With a borrowed lira he sent a message to our cousin, <i>Giacomo Annuci, who spoke for him, but not until my brother and his family spent two nights in jail.” Emil smiled. “I Imagine what his wife, </i>Giuseppina, said when they were alone.” He rubbed his clean-shaven face, not a wisp or stubble of hair, not even a thin mustache. “Things will be better in Sicilia, someday. They will and we will come home. Sicilia is our home; it will always be our home, and nothing can change what I feel.”   </p>
<p id="page_369" class="calibre6">I daydreamed, staring at Amaria  </p>
<p class="calibre6">When it was over, Emil was still talking and what did miss?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My wife says we will never return home, and this makes me angry inside, because I know it might be true, and this guilt I have is a hundred times worse when she says it. But I forgive her honesty. She is a fine mother. A gentle woman. She cries at the sight of a wounded animal, or a beautiful flower. How does she survive in this ugliness, I have asked myself?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He took her hand, and she was embarrassed and looked away.  Santo asks him, “What guilt do you have? I do not understand.” Emil starred through an open window.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My father. What did I do to him? I left him behind to provide for himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I clear my throat to ask a question.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is he sick, or an invalid?  These old men and old women are survivors.” I thought of mama and papa. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe,” he said. “Maybe he will be alright. I begged him to come. But no, he will die where he was born, and he refused to leave. Mama and my sister passed when the typhoid hit, on the same day, almost at the same hour. They were close. They did everything together.” Amaria took his hand and he smiled. “They died together. I wrote my brother, but the letter came back. ‘He is dead,’ I thought. But now I know he is alive, and I am thankful for it, but now I will have to tell him about mama and my sister *Silvana when we meet again.”  </p>
<p id="page_370" class="calibre6">“Silvana? Your sister? Did she have children?” I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre6">He shook his head. “She did not. You see, she…well, she was not right…and she was always home with mama…she never married.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She was born <i class="calibre5">brutè</i>, disfigured.” Amaria said. “With the mind of a child, but the soul of an angel…my children miss her very much.” She made the sign of the cross.    </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Febbre tifoidea</i>. His mother and sister died from the typhoid. Is there a family in Sicilia who has not felt the cut of this beast that kills for fun?  The last time it hit our village, maybe twenty died in a month. For every family, there was a victim.  It was zio *Ferdinando Sparacino, in my family, who withered and died in a week, and that was a merciful death, as some hung on for a month, delirious and suffering, only to die in the end.  Luca lost a cousin; two cousins in truth, but one he hated, and will not count him as family. We buried babies and young children, near half the twenty, and the echoes of weeping mothers were heard, day and night on the mountain, for weeks. I see the mothers and grandmothers at the cemetery, kneeling at the graves, praying, and asking God, “why?” Mama said it is better a baby dies than a young child. She learned this year before, when my brother, just a few days old, died for some reason, and she was thankful it was not one of us.           </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Too much spring rain,” Emil said. “The rain mixes with waste from the animals and it makes <i class="calibre5">febbre tifoidea</i>, and when it washes into the wells, the poison is spread through the village. I wonder why mama and Silvana died and not me?  I drank from the same well. Not a cough or a sneeze. Now I am half an orphan. At my age,” and he smiled, and I understood the smile and did not think him disrespectful. Amaria hugged her husband, a small hug, not enough to make a scene. No one turned to look, or stare.  </p>
<p id="page_371" class="calibre6">“The poor souls,” Emil said after a silence, “My wife lost her mother, her father. Now she has only me and her children. She is lucky to have them. I wonder, am I a stone around her neck? All the time I wonder.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The engines squealed, like a pig, then turned over and I feel the cabin floor vibrate. I looked out through the window, in sort of a trance. I see whitecaps in the Strait, and I thought it will be a rough ride; we should have stayed home. The ferry sat still, idling and the smoke and the smell made me sick, but after the threats and the fear, the Carabinieri let us go.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A sailor waived to the wheelhouse and the engines revved, and she pulled slowly out into the straits. We were bumped by waves, and I see sickness in some of the passengers, but in a while, we would be at the docks at Villa San Giovanni.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am sure your father will be all right,” Santo said . “It is like Antonino says, these men are survivors…they can live on rocks.”  Emil looked nervous, like a man riding into hell.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are right, my father <i class="calibre5">is</i> over eighty. But his own man…he needs no one.” He said it, I thought he meant it, but no, his eyes watered, and he turned away. For a man to cry in front of his wife and children, a Sicilian man, what can be worse? It is like a punishment for some terrible crime.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil forced the words from his mouth. “I begged him. As God is my judge, I begged him to come, but he refused. ‘I will not be a burden,’ he said to me.  He said it over and over until I was almost crazy. He feared his grandchildren would remember him as a burden, not a man. He is old, and sometimes loses control of himself, and he would not have his grandchildren watch him die slowly, and their last memory of him would be of an old man who is a child, not able to care for himself.”     </p>
<p id="page_372" class="calibre6">Amaria leaned and touched her cheek to his cheek.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You did what a son should do. You honored your father, but he made his own decision.” She pulled a handkerchief from her sleeve (it looked to be fine linen) and gently patted her husband’s eyes. “It is the salt air,” she said, in his defense. “It bothers his eyes and they water.” I nodded, only half listening, as I thought about my mother and father, wondering, what have I done for them?  Abandoned them. This is what I have done.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought Luca was sleeping, but no; he cleared his throat. “Who will care for your father?” he said to Emil, in his judgement voice.          </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil leaned and looked past me to where Luca sat at the end of the bench.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Signuri. I understand what you mean. He is not all alone. His blessed sister, *Antonia Pallazo, will check him every day. She promised. She is old. Not old like papa, but old.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria took her husband’s hand, “Your father made his own decision,” she said, softly and I could tell she was a good and loving woman. “You did the right thing for your family and your father knew it and wanted you to make this decision.” She smiled and he smiled, and I see the great influence she had on her husband, as beautiful women can sometimes do this to a man. This I understood about women, but nothing else. She squeezed Emil’s hand.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Our children are first. You said it and you always mean what you say.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil sighed. “No matter what he said, he did not want us to leave. The look on his face the day we left, like pain from a knife in his heart.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He made his own decision,” she said. “He refused to leave.”     </p>
<p id="page_373" class="calibre6">“Si. I know. He kept saying ‘go…go.’ I will be all right. But that look on his face.” Emil smiled at his wife. What he must think when he looks at her, ‘how good God is to have sent her to me.’ She must be a special gift from God, as what other reason could there be for a man like him to have a woman like her? Si, a gift from God.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">We made it to Villa San Giovanni, thank God, but there were six other boats waiting and no empty slip and we bounced in the strait and waited.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo looked at me with the look of a lost little boy. “How long do we wait?’   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Until our turn,” I said. “This is how it is done on the sea. Like civilized men.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil leaned across the aisle. “I know nothing about boats. Were you in the Italian Navy? You seem to know about these things.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. The army. Drafted (<i class="calibre5">coscrizione</i>) but kicking and screaming all the way.” He laughed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I understand. I was passed over, thank God.” He touched his chest. “My heart. Weak. I have not been out of Casamara, until yesterday. I am nervous, worrying for my family…what will come next for us. Do you know where to find the train to Napoli?”        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A half mile from the docks, I think. This is what they say, but we can ask.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are going to the train. You are welcome to join us. As you say, it is only a short walk.” His face lit up and he smiled.  “My wife will feel better when her feet are on dry land.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">A deckhand announced, loud, with authority, that the ferry will not dock until a slip opens. He walked the aisle, listening to groans and complaints, for a good hour, or more, while we floated in the bay at Villa San Giovanni.  The tide was retreating, and I see the boats falling at the dock, a strange sight. A freighter passed within a hundred feet, and the wake jostled us and shook the ferry. The rocking and bouncing made me sick, and I looked for a low railing, should I need to <i class="calibre5">vomito</i>.  </p>
<p id="page_374" class="calibre6">Emil shook his head. “I pray I am up to this. For my families’ sake, and for no other reason, but I am afraid I will let them down.” I knew this feeling, of being less of a man than other men; I have felt it many times, and now, at this moment, I feel it again. Emil hugged his children. “I tell myself you are only a  tailor. No hero.  What does a tailor do but  sew holes in pants and mend ripped seams in shirts, no more? Nothing heroic.” He gathers the fabric of his jacket. “I cut and sew,” he said. “What do I know about all of this?” He apologized, thinking he had embarrassed himself before his wife and children, and strangers, whose judgements are the worst, but his family will always forgive this weakness.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He stared at the cabin wall. “I have let them down…what will happen now?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who knows? Tomorrow? The next day, or when they open the door…who knows?” Emil moved close to his wife; they touched, as if in a trance. There was a minute, maybe two minutes of silence (who can judge this kind of time?) then Emil clears his throat.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You and your friends. Where do you go if I may ask?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“To America,” I answered, forcing a smile. “My cousin, <i class="calibre5">Natale Chillemi</i>, promised to meet us and said we will have work, in America, like your brother promised you.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you men from Messina?” he asked, looking straight away at Santo.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, not Messina. “From <i class="calibre5">Ali’ Superiore</i>, south of Messina. In the hills, near Monte Elena and Monte Etna.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then you are farmers.” He said it in a way there was nothing else we could be, but farmers. Luca hated farming, even being called a farmer, or thought of as a farmer. He stood straight up and removed his cap, nodding to Amaria, politely, and offered Emil his hand, and they shook.    </p>
<p id="page_375" class="calibre6">“Signuri, I ask you: what is a farmer? It is not right to say we are farmers. My friends here enjoy the smell of shit, but it does not make them farmers,” at this he laughed and when he laughed the children laughed, stopping only when their mother gave them a dirty look.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Rich men are the farmers. We are the Labor. My friends call themselves farmers, not me.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you are not a farmer like your friends, what do you do, if I may ask?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca points to himself. “Me? As I said, I shovel shit and pick fruit. That’s what I do. </p>
<p class="calibre6">This answer confused Emil. “You say you are no farmer, and you laugh about it.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca pulled at his ear, a nervous habit all his life.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are correct, signuri. I am <i class="calibre5">not</i> a farmer, but I work on a farm when the owner allows me this privilege. <i class="calibre5">He</i> is the farmer. You must own a farm to be a farmer, and I do not…we do not.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">This argument I have heard a thousand times. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But if you work at farming, then you are a farmer,” Emil insisted. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then a horse pulling a plow is a farmer?” Emil smiled.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You have me there, signuri. I have never thought of it that way.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca looked past Emil, or through him, and stared at Amaria; a blind man could see the shameful thoughts he held in his mind. I had this fear in my gut that he would say something a woman should not hear, but he did not. Luca bowed slightly to Emil and his wife.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My apologies, signora. I talk too much.” He tipped the brim of his cap, as he sat and waited. Amaria never spoke while the men were speaking, and some men, knowing nothing more about her, would say she is a good Sicilian wife, a good Sicilian mother. Her daughter, beautiful like the mother, said she was hungry, and the boy was hungry, too. Amaria drew from her bag a nice loaf of Sicilian bread; golden crust and fresh, I think, from the sweet smell, and broke off two good-sized pieces, passing one to each of her children, that they ate slowly. She gave a smaller piece to Emil.   </p>
<p id="page_376" class="calibre6">“No, grazie,” he said, pushing it away. “But ask our friends.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiace</i>,” she said, offering me her husband’s bread.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Excuse my poor manners,” she said, “please share our bread?” She spoke softly, gently and I believe sincere. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, grazie,” I said, refusing to take food from a child. She nodded and smiled.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I understand, signuri, but we have enough to share. The bread is fresh, not stale. My husband bought it from a vendor on the docks, just this morning. What is better than fresh bread?”  Her son, Giovanni, finished his bread and she gave him another piece. I was right to refuse. I felt good about it, though I was hungry.           </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are right, signora. Nothing is better,” I said. “But we are fine. It would not be right for us to take food out of the mouths of your children.” She was grateful. “Any other time I would have…”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, no. I understand. Please. Your children are first.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">She broke off bread and handed it to Emil, who took it this time, but turned away as if ashamed by his hunger. He ate quickly, and wiped the crumbs from his chin with a white cloth taken from his jacket pocket.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are correct, signuri,” he said. “Who knows what he will see tomorrow? Who knows when we eat again?” Amaria brushed crumbs from her jacket and put the rest of the loaf in her bag and closed the flap. She did not take bread, as I recall, and this is what a good Sicilian mother would do. She would die first, and happily, to feed her children. Many mothers would do the same, I suppose.         </p>
<p id="page_377" class="calibre6">Luca whispers to me, “what a beauty she is.” He sighed. Me? I saw a married woman, another mans wife, with two children, a husband sitting a few feet away, with a keen eye and a good sense. I know Luca is crazy; I knew this when we were children. He would climb the tallest trees in the orchard and jump, maybe ten, fifteen feet, screaming to the ground. If he landed on hard ground or rocks, no matter. This is what a crazy man does.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil spoke quietly with his wife, who was looking over his shoulder, staring off at something I could not tell. We caught each other’s eye, and she smiled at me, a clean and pure smile, like Carmela’s smile, and for a moment Carmela was next to me, but Amaria was not Carmela. When Emil cleared his throat, I worried he would ask why his wife had smiled at me.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Signuri?  I am sorry,” he said, speaking directly to me. “I know we have exchanged names, but at these times, my mind is like…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino,” I said. “Sparacino. And this is my cousin, Santo.” I leaned and touched Luca’s shoulder, “and this man, who is not a farmer, but works a farm, is Luca Ponto. We are on our way to America.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. It is a smart thing you do, traveling with family and a friend. Three men together are good.” He hugged his daughter and smiled.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Traveling with children,” he paused, “and women. There is much to worry about.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I have not traveled with women, but I understood what he meant. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How did you get to Messina?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo glanced down at his boots. “We walked from Ali’.”   </p>
<p id="page_378" class="calibre6">Emil shook his head. “Walked?  My God, how far is it? Fifteen, twenty miles?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“All of that, and more. Maybe thirty miles, I think”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil laughed. “And you walked all the way? My hat is off to you. We rode in a horse cart, owned by a fine friend who I will never see again.” Amaria touched his knee and he smiled at her. “A full day’s ride and most of the night. It was hardest on my wife and my daughter.” He looked for words with his hands. “You see, women and young girls…well, men and woman are not the same…” I did not understand, at first, but it hit me what he was saying, and I was rightly embarrassed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where do you stop?” he said, and his wife and daughter looked away.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Me…my son, well, any place is...” He wiped his forehead, smiling to hide his embarrassment. “Anyway, what was I saying? Si. I remember. *<i class="calibre5">Giacomo Rezzi</i>. A fine shoemaker and a good friend to me since we were children, like my brother, but better. We never fought, not even a harsh word between us. How will I ever repay him this debt?”  He bowed his head and clasped his hands, as he prayed, I believed. “Giacomo has no family, but us. <i class="calibre5">Vedovo</i>. He is a widower. His only child died with his wife; they died together, some years ago. I begged him. ‘Come with us. What is there here for you?’ But he is <i class="calibre5">testa dura</i>. His head is a rock. ‘No, grazie,’ he would say. ‘After much thought and counsel from the priest,’ he believed it was not right to leave his wife and child behind, though they had passed. This I did not understand, but I have never lived in his skin, or walked in his shoes. I grabbed him and embraced him hard and promised we would return to Sicilia. ‘No. You will not,’ he said, without anger, though we were leaving him behind, with no one. ‘Your children,’ he said, with tears in his eyes, and he hugged them both and we cried together. For a week before he took us across the hills, he was coughing a little blood.  ‘Not much,’ he said. ‘A cold, no more…do not worry about me.’  I believe he is ill, this wonderful man, and I do not believe the priest told him he must stay, but he was afraid he could not make the trip and slow us down. I believe he will die soon, and I will not see him again.”  </p>
<p id="page_379" class="calibre6">‘We will be back.’ What do these words mean, that are said a thousand times a day all over Sicilia?  It is what we say when we leave and there is nothing else to say, or we are ashamed of what we are doing, and by saying it, we feel a little better.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">‘We will be back.’ </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your children are quiet, well behaved,” I said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Fear will keep you quiet. They are frightened.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">They sat quietly, like good children, with no emotion, as if none of this was important, and meant nothing. Their home, they would never see it again. This they knew and where they were going, that they were sailing into the night, and like the rest of us, they were feeling for the walls, like a blind man walking into a strange room.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They understand everything,” Emil said. “Leaving home. Leaving their grandfather. They know I sold everything, even the old horse, that they both loved. A gift from their grandfather.” Agatina, the daughter, reached for her father’s hand.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I love my horse,” she said, as she dropped her head. “Papa said maybe I will see her again someday,” and her voice became weaker, and her last words, “but I will not. I understand.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have failed them,” he said. “It is my fault. A man must provide for his family, and I cannot. But what is the use in beating myself?  There are plenty who will do it for me.  Anyway, I look to tomorrow when we sail to America…on a Spanish boat, of all things.” He laughed. “<i class="calibre5">The Antonio Lopez</i>.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was startled. “<i class="calibre5">Antonio Lopez </i>is our boat,” I said. He smiled. </p>
<p id="page_380" class="calibre6">“Maybe we will spend time together on the boat. It is a pleasant surprise.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I shook my head. “But she sails tonight, not tomorrow.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tonight? No. Not tonight, signuri…you are mistaken.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">He took a paper from his pocket, and read it slowly, his lips moving.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are both right,” he said. “She sails at 12:30 in the morning, on the tide. That is tomorrow, of course, but since we will not sleep before she sails, then it is tonight, as you said.  Si, yes. We are both correct.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was wrong, no matter how he twisted the truth, but he chose not to embarrass me in front of Luca and Santo and his family, and we were strangers. I am nothing to him, no friend or brother, or cousin. His wife says he is a skilled tailor, none better.  I am farm labor. What fool cannot dig a hole, or pick fruit?  But who can cut a suit, or sew a straight line? His honesty, I think, the way he said what he thought no matter how it shamed him, if he saw it as the truth. Some would say his honesty was a weakness, but honesty must come with a price, or it is no virtue. This is what Patri Carmine says, and I believe it to be true.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">One of the crew, a tall, hefty sailor, walked the aisles, repeating, “Ready to leave the boat. And watch the gangplank. It is greasy from the oil and sea scum.”  Without warning, Luca grabs the sailor by the arm as he passed our spot. The sailor was annoyed and jerked his arm from Luca’s grip, and they traded harsh and threatening words. Even though Luca was in the wrong, he would fight anyway, as the wrong of it made no difference to him. In the end, their war was only words and dirty looks.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Una domanda</i> (a question)” he says to the sailor, who did not respond or acknowledge Luca, and this made Luca angry. He asked again, but louder, that they could hear him through the cabin.   </p>
<p id="page_381" class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Una domanda</i>.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, you have a question,” the sailor said in the foulest of tones. “Everyone here has a question,” he said, as he waved his hand across the cabin. “Hurry up. I have other duties.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I knew Luca was seething in his gut, as this pissy sailor took a piece of his manhood; he was barely twenty years old, but tall and muscular.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How far to the train?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The train?  What…”  I interrupted the sailor.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We go to Napoli,” I said, with respect, not to stoke the fire. He laughed and mocked me all the same.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Another americani,” he said, with hate in his eyes. “We are filthy with you people today…look twenty or thirty americani,” and he pointed to different men and woman, even children, minding their own business. He frowned, but a fake frown, I believed.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have bad news, americano.” He held up two yellow, crooked fingers, and pushed them at my face. “Two days ago, the train to Napoli was less than a mile away from the docks where we land. But the storms, the floods have washed away the track for miles.” When I asked on another train, he seemed to celebrate our bad luck and misfortune, as I felt it in the feel of his voice.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s a shame for you,” he said. “The rains are bad this year.” He smiled, like a foolish man enjoying the pain of others would do. “Flooding along the track bed. The nearest train is maybe five, six miles from here, maybe farther. Too bad for you.” He turned and sneered at Luca,  who stood up fast, clenched fists, ready to fight. I wedged myself between them, until Luca relaxed, as this <i class="calibre5">cavone</i> of a sailor did not back away an inch.       </p>
<p id="page_382" class="calibre6">“Any more questions? Find the Harbormaster,” he said, and walked to the cabin door and yelled “everyone out,” like a cop. “And watch your step… the plank is bad.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I help Emil free a suitcase jammed under the seat.  He cursed the case, that did not seem in his nature. But he was tense and nervous, like the rest of us; together we pulled hard and the case broke free.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am lost,” he said. “Where do we go from here? I am confused by all of this. They told me the train is only a few blocks from the dock…an easy walk.” Amaria nudged her children who each were dragging a small bag, while their father struggled with the other bags they brought. “Do you have the bread?” he asked his wife; yes, she nodded. I pulled my bag from under the seat and moved toward the door; something in my head said, ‘go back.’ In between two benches rested the pouch with my grandfather’s vines. I slung it over my shoulder, and marked it in my head, that a good thing has happened to me today.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I walked slowly and carefully, down the god damned plank, that was nothing but a heavy board, but narrow, near twenty feet long, covered with green scum. It was slippery, like an icy mountain road. It bounced near a foot in the middle, and I struggled to keep my balance. An old man in front of me, not that old, but poor on his feet, slipped and near fell, but he was fast and grabbed my arm and I caught hold of the rope railing before we both went into the drink.  His wife was as old, but better on her feet. She thanked me for my patience and took his arm to help him along.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">No problema</i>, *<i class="calibre5">signura</i>,” I said. “No damage done.” Her man apologized for being old, swearing he would have aged better if he knew old age would destroy his body, as it has. “Nobody tells you this,” he said, and we both laughed about it. When I came nearer to the middle of the plank, where it dipped the most and vibrated the most, I hear a scream, so high and shrill, it cut through me, like a bullet. It was a poor woman who fell, her left leg hanging over the plank, just above the water, the other folded under her body. Screaming, she twisted and rolled about from the pain, and her body slid to the edge of the plank, but two men grabbed her before she went into the water. The man behind me staggered and recovered, but his bags fell into the bay, one by one.  He cursed the woman for falling and his bags for ending in the drink. When the plank settled, sailors secured it and two men carried the woman off and laid her on the ground. Caps in hand and heads bowed, they apologized because they could not stay and help. There was a train to Napoli, and they said she was only shaken up, so they felt right in leaving her to her own. They missed(or ignored)the blood that covered the gangplank where she fell (almost black as it was now mixed with the green slime), on her dress, on the ground around her, that it looked like a slaughterhouse floor; they missed the screaming and her pleas for help. They missed nothing. They saw it all, and left her there and hurried away, like thieves in the night. A few of the passengers stopped and remarked how bad she looked; none had the time to help, but one or two said a quick prayer, and moved on. A few wished her <i class="calibre5">buona fortuna</i>, and <i class="calibre5">velocità diu</i>(God speed). Meaningless words.    </p>
<p id="page_383" class="calibre6">Who was she? She was the woman in the red hat, that was now floating in the bay.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Two women  stopped to gaze at the hat in the harbor, and said what a shame it was, as the hat appeared almost new and in good shape.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mio Diu</i>,” she cried. “Will someone help me?”  A tall man, dressed comfortably, but not a man I saw on the ferry, or in line back in Sicilia, bent and set a few lire on the ground next to her, saying he was sorry, but could not stay, after all, what could he do. There was an appointment he had to keep, but he was certain help would come, from good men on the ferry, or on order of the harbormaster. “Help will certainly come,” he said once more before he left. Amaria, Emil’s wife, stopped to help the woman, he tried to prod her on, but she knelt next to the woman and comforted her. When he nudged his wife, she turned and looked at him and took the woman’s hand and held it tight.   </p>
<p id="page_384" class="calibre6">“She is suffering,” Amaria said.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil shrugged his shoulder and seemed helpless. “What can we do?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She is a child of God. She needs our help.” Emil shook his head, then turned away. The woman begged for her life, as she squeezed Amaria’s hand, as hard as she could, I believe.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you leave me, I will die,” she said, and the pain hit her, and she twisted and screamed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">To this day, I cannot imagine the agony she felt.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria stared at her husband. “Please,” he said. “The train. We must go.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">She refused and would not leave the woman alone. Emil threw up his hands.            </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your family? Your husband? Is he with you?” she asks the woman.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The pain hit her again, and she screamed out, and the hairs on my neck stood straight. I have admitted my fears, except this fear, the fear of pain. Even a little pain is too much pain. Even the pain of others if I see them suffer, or can I tolerate their begging when they scream and plead for it to stop. The children hovered over their mother, but she waved them away, and slowly lifted the woman’s dress, and there was the jagged end of a broken bone that had pierced the flesh near her ankle. I stepped away, in shock, as I had only seen this once before on a dog (smothered by the owner)but I have heard bones crack and break, like tree limbs snapping. To see one near broke off, on a human, is a thousand times worse. I regretted not moving on when I was able. Emil was kneeling alongside his wife, and they spoke quietly. He said ‘no,’ but she said ‘yes,’ and he said ‘no’ again. After a while he left her alone tending the woman, who was still twisting on the ground and moaning in pain. Finally, after all the other passengers had moved on, it hit him hard, that his family was in a bad way because his wife would not leave the woman alone.            </p>
<p id="page_385" class="calibre6">“What can we do for her?” I ask.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I do not know,” he said, almost angry with me, and for what reason?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My wife is too kind, too caring, and this is the problem.”  His hands shook, his face dripped with sweat. I believed, then, he would pass out and die before the poor bastard on the ground; it was the first time I thought of a woman as a bastard, and I was ashamed, though I have not thought so since.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He wiped his forehead dry. “She will not leave this poor woman. I know her.” He loosened his collar and wiped his forehead, it seemed, for the hundredth time.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">I reminded Emil, “The train is four, five miles from here. Maybe more. If you stay, you will miss the boat.” He understood what I said and was overwhelmed by it, as his eyes began to water, and I was embarrassed for him.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The shifting wind stirred up the dust and dirt.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“God forgive me,” he said. “I will have to drag her away…she will not leave. What do I do? She is a fine and wonderful woman?” He shook his head, as some men shake their heads in disgust, but I do not believe he was disgusted with her. We watched her, kneeling quietly on the wet ground next to this fallen woman, tending to her, like you tend family, or a good friend.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She is too decent for this god damned world,” he said, looking away. The ferry sailor, who warned about the gangplank, stopped and gawked and shook his head. Emil asked him for help. “What can I do?” he said. “She was warned. See the Harbormaster,” and he turned his back to us. “He will help you.”    </p>
<p id="page_386" class="calibre6">Why did we stop? Why do we wait? This is what Luca asked; Santo said that with prayer, help would come, and she might survive. He makes the sign of the cross, saying it was a sad thing that she suffered, but it is the will of God, or why did it happen?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Everything is part of the Plan,” he says, “But the reason cannot always be seen. </p>
<p class="calibre6">I ignored Santo because he was not the one on the ground.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Blood soaked the ground near her foot.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">How long before she bleeds to death?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Her red hat was floating in the bay.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I made an argument to Luca, that it is wrong, a sin, a bad sin to abandon this injured woman, bleeding and in pain, although I did not believe it to be the will of God, as Santo said. Listen to her screams. What kind of person has no feeling for her suffering? But they mocked me, my friends. Santo said we owe her prayer, nothing more, as she is not family. Luca was not as civilized as Santo, thinking we owed her nothing, not even a prayer, as she is nothing to us. He said, and what he said angered me, that I only worried about this woman because of my desire to stay close to Amaria.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are full of shit,” I said, but in my heart, I believed it <i class="calibre5">was</i> part of it. Am I a foolish man, a man with no sense? A man who always loses. Is that me? And for some reason, I felt good with Emil, even after so short a time (maybe it was Amaria). I pull him aside, man to man. “You must control your wife,” I said, but I meant it generously, not how some Sicilian men mean it, with a club, or a kick in the teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre6">He stared at me.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Control my wife? Is she a mule, an ass? Should I beat her if she refuses to move?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course not. I did not mean she is an animal.” He kicked at the loose dirt.  </p>
<p id="page_387" class="calibre6">“I told her we cannot stay. No matter how much this woman suffers. She was angry with me. ‘It is not like you’ she said. ‘Is this what you want your children to see?’” She was beautiful and a genius. ‘Children’ hit him in the right place, and came the shame, and I knew he would not push her, that they would stay, and she would tend the woman until help came, or until the woman died. I made my decision. There were hours before we had to be in Napoli, and we were taking the train and we would be there with time to spare, even if I was here another hour. How long could it be for help to come? An hour? Two hours? No more.  I give Luca and Santo their release, their leave to go, saying they were free to do what was right, as they saw it. I held out their tickets; I offer them most of what little money I had. They were pissed and I was bullied, but when it failed, Luca threw out his chest and raised his voice.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And the train?” he said. “When we miss the train…do we walk to Napoli?” He kicked at a piling with the side of his foot, and he groaned, then lied, swearing he felt no pain.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Santo Antonino</i>,” he called me as he limped away. In the end, they both stayed, but they offered no help or assistance, but wandered the docks, counting the time until this poor woman died. Amaria wanted the woman carried to a bench and off the ground, but we feared a wrong move and her ankle would break off her leg. We refused, and after some thought she agreed it was not the wise thing to do. This woman became worse by the minute. She needed a doctor, as a doctor was her only salvation, if she could be saved all. Prayer, kind words are a wonderful thing, I am sure of it, but what healing power did they have, or if they had it, was it greater than a doctor’s power? We lied, pure and simple, that help was coming, hoping this would soothe her and settle her down. She tells Amaria her husband and son were waiting for her on the docks in Napoli, where they were to meet at midnight and take the boat to America.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I believe she was talking about our boat, the <i class="calibre5">Antonio Lopez</i>.  </p>
<p id="page_388" class="calibre6">I kneel next to her but refused to look at the blood or her ankle.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Could it be the <i class="calibre5">Antonio Lopez</i>?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">All she knew it was a Spanish boat with a Spanish name. Santo admitted to chills on his arms and his neck, like me, that she was taking the same boat to America, but it did nothing to change his mind. As she lay there, sometimes screaming, sometimes whimpering, Santo asked God save her from the suffering. Luca spit on the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Morte. </i>She is dead. These <i class="calibre5">Calabrese, </i>they are little better than <i class="calibre5">barbari</i>. We should think of ourselves and move on.”  Who knew if she was <i class="calibre5">Calabrese</i>, or not?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I see a soldier, a few hundred feet away, no more, leaning against the guard shack at the end of the dock, doing nothing but trying to ignore us. He is the authority here, I thought, so he must help her. It is his sworn duty. I grab Emil’s arm and point to the shack and the guard, and we doubled timed it to where he stood. The guard see’s us and moved to the other side of the shack, and leaned against a light pole, just staring across the Strait, back to Sicilia. He opened a small pouch of tobacco and rolled himself a cigarette, and he ignored us when we confronted him. As I could see he was no book soldier; he needed a shave, and his uniform was wrinkled (there were rips and stains on his jacket).  He was well past thirty, with no rank, and most likely a bungler and a fuck-up, who did not mind all the bird shit, as long as the officers they let him be. His eyes wandered the dock, as if he did not see us, but he did, or he chose to ignore two men who were not his own. Emil cleared his throat, and went right into the story, as the soldier tried to light his cigarette, cursing when it would not catch in the stiff wind, but when it did catch, he smiled. He did see the woman fall, and it looked like a bad fall. Was it bad, he asked? At the end of the story, he took a deep breath and shrugged his shoulders.  “What do you want from me?” he asked Emil. “I am no doctor…you need a doctor.” The ash from a poor roll dropped to his sleeve; he brushed it away, cursing the quality of papers provided the Italian soldier. He bought his own tobacco, the finest from Turkey, but not the papers.      </p>
<p id="page_389" class="calibre6">“They pay me to watch you,” he said, pointing to both of us.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“To catch god damned thieves, if I am able.” He admitted when he was tired, sometimes he worked with blinders on, like a horse.  “Once in a while I fish a drunk out of the water. But the woman, laying on the ground, she needs a doctor, not a guard. What do I know about these things?”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Can you find her a doctor?” Emil asked. The soldier stared, as if in deep thought, then he stepped to the side, looking past Emil. “I see a fine figured woman kneeling on the ground,” he said, straining his eyes for a better look. “I bet she is good at what she does.”  He laughed a  dirty laugh. There should have been a fight, but Emil backed away; he only glared at this ignorant sonofabitch, letting the insult pass.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">We could see Amaria rolling her white shawl into a pillow, that she fit under the fallen woman’s head, and with her fine linen jacket she covered her arms against the chill. Emil saw red.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The jacket…<i class="calibre5">mio Diu</i>, not the jacket,” he said, kicking the guard shack. This fine linen was his wedding gift to Amaria and the envy of every woman in their village. He spent nights before their wedding, cutting and recutting; stitching and restitching, until the jacket, made of the finest cloth from Milano, was no less than perfect. His miser of a boss allowed him only one lamp to work by, and he made foolish mistakes because of the poor light, and what should have taken two nights, or three nights, took six nights, and his eyes and head ached from the work. And now, in an instant, the fine linen jacket was ruined forever. Emil looked away and threw his hands in the air, saying with anger, but acceptance, he could not watch the jacket destroyed by dirt and blood.  </p>
<p id="page_390" class="calibre6">“Dirt and blood ruins fine fabric,” he said.             </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where is her family,” the soldier asked.  ‘Why does she travel alone. Decent women…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I cut him off, this fucking barbarian.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Waiting for her in Napoli,” I said. “We are all going to Napoli.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Certo</i>,” the guard mumbled. “You are all going to Napoli.” He laughed. “When you get to Napoli, you will find her family and they will get her. No?” Emil protested. She cannot be left bleeding on the dock for God knows how long. The soldier repeated, there was nothing he could do. Call a doctor or leave her. Someone will help, sooner or later.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Or maybe you can take her to Via Lucia, a few blocks from here. There is a doctor.” He scratched his head. “No. he is probably in the hills. The Master will know.”  He points to a building, an old stone hut, better used for storage, as it had no windows and only one door.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But I will warn you, Signuri *Vittorio is, uh, probably taking an early dinner.” He forced a laugh. “There is this woman who cooks for him…his wife is sickly. But he is still a young man…you understand,” and he smiled. “You are a man of the world, no?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, si, I understand, but we need…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil grabbed my arm. “Who…who is with her?” he asked, stuttering like a fool.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who is with her?” he repeated, and went back on a run, like a madman, waving his arms and calling her name, “Amaria, Amaria, are you all right?”  A man in black was kneeling next to the fallen woman, his head down, and his hand laying across her forehead. A priest, that’s all, giving her a blessing and trying to ease her pain.     </p>
<p id="page_391" class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mio marito</i>(husband),” the woman screamed in pain and grabbing this priest by the arm, but he pulled away.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Let my husband know…let him know where I am…he will come for me.” Her pain, I believed, was more intense, and on this I can only imagine her suffering, as she spoke by screaming the words, and they were not clearly understood. In the army I see this pain only one time, when a wheel broke off an ammunition wagon, and it overturned and trapped a soldier from <i class="calibre5">Pietramelara</i>, breaking off his feet from his legs, and they hung on by the skin and a thin piece of muscle. His ankles were swinging in the wind, they say, but I looked away and thankfully I missed most of the sight. He prayed to die, this I heard, and I have not heard a man pray for death since that day. I think he died. I hope he died, as it was his wish and I believe he was sincere. Whenever there is a fierce storm and I hear limbs snapping off in the trees, I think of that day and that poor bastard. Now this. Better her than me. Si. Of course, I am ashamed, but it is an honest thought, that most men have when the going is tough, and bad things happen to other people. Better him than me. Find a man who has never had such a thought, and you have found a fool.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">The priest with Amaria was Patri *Generoso Iamita, pastor of the Chiesa di Sant’Annunziatta, who passed by, minding his business on a walk by the sea, when Amaria cried for help, and he religiously put his business aside to help the sick. The woman on the ground was holding Amaria’s rosary, gripping it tight against her chest.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria says the priest gave a blessing to this poor soul. “It calmed her down, but she has lost so much blood, she may not live unless we get help.” The priest agreed; he has seen this before and it is always fatal. “God help us all,” he said, bowing his head and making the sign of the cross, like a good and pious man.   </p>
<p id="page_392" class="calibre6">He was a tall, taller than most, and carried himself well; the kind of priest who has a woman in his parish, sometimes two, or three. Near forty, he walked with the manner of an aristocrat, and I would wager he came from an important family in Calabria, as this is how they chose priests to work in the city churches. This I have been told. His health seemed good, as his face was thin, not full and he was clean shaven, but all over he was well fed. He moved well for a big man, with lightness in his feet, as he seemed to glide across the ground as he walked. “Fat” seemed too harsh a judgement, though priests eat well, even when the parish starves. Luca tells him that priests such as Patri Amita, from good and wealthy families, enjoy the city churches, because there is money in the cities, as the rich give to Mother Church, hoping to buy their way into eternal salvation, avoiding the fires of hell; money they have stolen, they use to wash away sins and cleanse their souls. A good plan, as I could tell. Santo had not heard this before. Patri Carmine has said nothing about it. Santo grabbed my arm. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“These people give money to the Church…and their souls are saved?”       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Bullshit,” Luca said. “They rot like the rest of us.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">But these priests enjoy the cities, as I hear the food in the Church house is better, and there is more of it. And women to counsel. Luca is no believer; he has no doubt, and no respect for the Church or priests, I am sorry to say. He is full heathen. Me? I was glad to see a priest show up and take charge. What did this talk have to do with the poor woman on the ground?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil removed his hat, nervously rubbing his fingers along the brim, as he stood silently before the priest, like an altar boy being cussed out for talking during mass, or some other infraction. “Patri,” he said, respectfully, his eyes half closed and staring at the ground, “We must get to our train…I mean…we need to find the train to Napoli, but my wife, in her heart, she cannot leave this poor woman alone.” The priest stares at Emil, the woman on the ground, neither offering or denying his help, nodding once, again, and a third time.  </p>
<p id="page_393" class="calibre6">“We have nowhere to turn, patri.” The good priest tightened his lips.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What more can I do?” he said, staring piously at Emil.  “I have given her my blessing and I will pray for her. Even Il Papa would do no more. What else can I do?”  Cursing at a priest, is, well, like cursing your father and I have not done it, or have I thought of doing it until now. I say his name slowly. “<i class="calibre5">Patri Amita,</i> ” and he looked straight at me, but I held the anger I felt toward this man, for his attitude on this dying woman. She screamed and I covered my ears, I am ashamed to say.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Patri. We cannot leave her on the street, like…like a puttana.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria was shocked; she protested my “wicked words.”  I apologize, saying the word slipped from my mouth.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A small ferry, of the type that travels between islands, probably from Lipari, docked while we were occupied, and paying no attention to the coming and going of things. Eight men got off the boat, with bags and suitcases, for a long journey. America? The army? Who knows? Not a man stopped or offered their help, or asked, “Cos'è successo?” as they passed by the fallen woman, wo was certainly bleeding to death. Patri Amita nodded to the men, and one bowed to him, respectfully. Another, I believe, made the sign of the cross, but in all, they paid little attention to the woman and had no interest in her suffering. They walked in single file, in the direction of the train, as we were told it might be. In a minute they rounded the corner and were gone, and we went back to our life at hand, that is, the suffering woman on the ground.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Patri, please, take charge of her,” Amaria begged the priest. She wrung her hands together and stared at the women on the ground.  “We must find our train to Napoli, but I cannot leave her. Take her to your church. Your Sisters will care for her until a doctor can be found.” The priest placed his hand gently on her shoulder and smiled.  </p>
<p id="page_394" class="calibre6">“There is nothing more I can do, Signora.” She talked on to convinced him, about suffering and prayer, but the priest stopped her with his stern look, and a finger in the air.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I respect your concern, signora. She <i class="calibre5">is</i> a child of God, but even a priest has limitations, I am sorry to say. Christ walked on water, but I have not seen a priest who could…maybe the Holy Father, Il Papa.”  She bowed her head, and asked for another blessing, but no, he said, one blessing was all that was needed and he turned his eyes away and would not look at her. He pulled a watch from under his black cassock; the watch was gold, I think. “Forgive me,” he said, “but I am late for something important.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I believed in my heart, Patri Carmine was a far better man than Amita, that he would never leave her here, covered with blood, writhing in the dirt, like a wounded animal, with the vultures circling, waiting to feed off the carcass. But he is not here, and Amita is the best we have.          </p>
<p class="calibre6">“As God as my judge, I am sorry,” he said, folding his hands, pious, in the way he was likely trained. They all do it. It must be in the book.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then you can help no more?” I ask.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He shook his head, “I can help no more. You are correct. It is *<i class="calibre5">Dottore Muccico, </i>you want. He has a special gift from God to heal, but I believe he is in the hills tending to the <i class="calibre5">contadini</i>.  An outbreak of some vile disease, or other, typhoid or typhus, is killing our Calabrian brothers. I say a mass a day for their souls, that they may join our Lord and Savior in Heaven.” He bowed his head, making the sign of the cross. “May God have mercy on their souls.”  </p>
<p id="page_395" class="calibre6">Then why is Amita here, I wondered, enjoying a fine walk along the sea, when he should be in the hills, in the trenches, and saving souls? This was near blasphemy, though he was not God, and I wanted to take it back, but could not, so I promised I would not think such a thought again.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I must leave now,” he said. “I see this poor woman is in good hands, thank God.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Patri, her name is *Grazia Stirpe,” Amaria tells the priest, as he prepares to leave.  “You should at least know her name and where she is from. <i class="calibre5">Roccamena</i>, near Palermu, on her way to meet her husband and son in Napoli.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ah, <i class="calibre5">si</i>, Grazia, a beautiful name. Did you know her name means ‘grace’ in Latin?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Grazia began to scream, asking why God had abandoned her. Patri scolds her, as she lay on the ground. “God loves you,” he said, “Why do you doubt Him?” She asked forgiveness, I think, but her voice was weak and failing and hard to hear.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Yes, I believe she asked forgiveness. I am certain.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then pray to God, the Lord” he said, in a stern and harsh tone, like the tone he might use on a man walking to the gallows, not forgiving, as I expected from a man of God. Where was his compassion?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You have committed the sin of <i class="calibre5">disperazione</i> (despair). Beg the Lord to forgive your sin. <i class="calibre5">Disperazione</i> is the worst of all sins, because it denies the power of God…the worst of all the sins.” She ignored him, as she called out her husband’s name. “Bernardo, Bernardo,” repeating it many times. I knelt close to her, and my knee touched her dress, and the blood made me sick. She became quiet, then her eyes closed, and I could not see her heartbeat. I hear someone ask, ‘is she dead?’ but she was not, her arm still moving, but slightly. I thought I might faint at this, but did not, thank God.        </p>
<p id="page_396" class="calibre6">Amaria cried all the more.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will not leave her,” she said to her husband, and the look on his face said it was the end for his family. My God, Amaria. What a beautiful woman; more beautiful to me now, at this moment, though covered with blood, because of her charitable act. The priest scolded her, that she was a foolish woman, and ordered that she obey her husband that is the rule of the Church.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your duty is with your husband. This is what Mother Church demands.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">She understood the rules of the Church, but in her heart, she could not leave. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then think of your children. Your duty to your husband.” But she ignored them, her husband and the priest, and soothed the woman’s forehead, wiping sweat from her face. The fine linen handkerchief she clutched in her hand was soaked in blood and ruined, like everything else. She tore away pieces of her dress and sent daughter Agatina to soak them in the sea water.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Be careful on the rocks.” she said, as her daughter ran to the water’s edge.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The sea water will soothe you,” she says to the fallen woman, who was drifting in and out, alive, then dead, alive again; quiet for a moment, then agitated, twisting, turning, crying in pain. Some of me wished her dead so we could move on, but I was ashamed at this selfish feeling, though it was an honest feeling.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She looks better, I think,” the priest said, from a good distance, away from the blood. The wind from the Strait kicked up, swirling in tight little circles, and I thought it was the Angel of Death coming for her.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">What a fool I was back then.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I think her color is coming back,” the priest said, but I could not see it, and I wondered, did he see it, or pretend to see it so he could be on his way with a clear conscience?    </p>
<p id="page_397" class="calibre6">“Prayer is powerful and divine,” he said, as he brushed at the dirt and weeds and burrs on his frock, that he picked up when he knelt next to her for only a few seconds. I see there was no blood, not a spot of blood on his cassock, but he was restless, and wanted to leave.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She is in good hands,” he said and smiled. “I must go, as I am late for an appointment with the bishop…church matters…on the far side of the city.” He smoothed his frock, again, and ran his hand through his hair, like a comb, fussing over himself as if he was on his way to meet <i class="calibre5">il papa. </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Bishop Vescovo Rossini</i> is a fine, but finicky man,” he says, waving his hand, as he backed away from where we stood. “God love him, but he demands I be on time. I have sworn to it.”  I thought to grab his cassock and not let go, but I am not so bold a man, as to attack a priest. Even Amita, who I thought was not much of a priest. I tried again to reason with him.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you do not help this woman, she will certainly die.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He turned and stared into my eyes, and I was uncomfortable that maybe I went too far, as what I said could be taken to mean if she dies, he killed her.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am insulted that you say I have refused to help this poor woman.” As I listened, I looked into his cold eyes, too cold for a man of God. He looked straight through me, to the sea.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I gave her my blessing, that is the blessing of the Church. Look at her. She is better. Anyone can see it. And while you stand here, doing nothing but babbling like a fool, I have asked God to give her the strength to endure the pain, until help arrives, or she…”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is not the priest’s fault,” Emil said, throwing his hands in the air.  He looked at his wife, still kneeling with this poor woman. “You are ruining us,” he said to her. She was shocked, then angry, as I could tell. She stood and faced him off, like most Sicilian women would never do. She pointed to the fallen women. “If I was on the ground, or one of your children, would you want these people to throw up their hands and say, ‘what else can we do,’ and walk away?”  She turned her back before he could answer, and there he stood alone, and everyone, except the priest, starred at him and at that moment he was a foolish man. Her anger was real, and I have never heard a woman talk to her husband in so harsh a way, in the presence of men not of the family. Emil looked at the faces and knew, he had made a fool of himself, and he was ashamed, as I could tell by the tone of his voice.  </p>
<p id="page_398" class="calibre6">“Please, Amaria, I understand what you say.” He took her hands, squeezing hard.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We must be in Napoli to catch the boat…you know this.” He spoke gently, respectfully, as I believe he did most of the time, except on this horrible day. She went on tending to the woman. From his jacket pocket he took an envelope, and in the envelope were four pieces of paper, folded neatly, and he kneeled on the ground next to his wife and laid the papers in front of her. She looked and shrugged her shoulders.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Quali sono queste cose? (What are the things)”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Boat tickets,” he said calmly. “Tickets we bought by selling our children’s horse.” She looked away and dropped her head, as if she was ashamed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Someday they will understand, and God help us if they do not. What will we be?  But you know we have steerage tickets…third class. They are of no value if we are not on the boat when it sails. <i class="calibre5">Non rimborso</i>. We cannot get our money back, or trade them for another say, and we have nothing left to sell.” He held the tickets in front of her; she pushed his hand away, and he put the tickets on the ground, covering them with a stone, the wind snapping at the envelope they were in. Emil was a good and decent man, I see, but weakened, almost done for, and what if she refuses to leave?  Amaria trembled, but did not give in. “This will be her end. The last day she will be on this earth. Helping her is a Christians duty.” The good priest was taken back; he furrowed his brow, almost insulted, I believe, by the tone she used, as if he was not a Christian and a priest and a good Catholic.       </p>
<p id="page_399" class="calibre6">“Signora. I forgive your disrespect. I see you are a caring woman. But understand, my duty is to her soul, not her body,” and saying it he showed no emotion. A cold man, like a hardened veteran of war; a good soldier, a soldier for Christ. His excuse for his coldness, I believed, was the suffering he had seen, but he swore he cared. “I can do no more for her. The rest I leave to others, in this case, to the doctor, *Signore Muccico. Find him as soon as possible. He is trained to mend a broken bone, with the help of God and by His grace.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">I recall Emil, frustrated by this moment, took the priests arm, and the priest towered over him, and they were an odd-looking pair of men, as they walked to a spot, maybe fifty feet away. Quiet at first, they talked with their hands, and in turn one seemed angry at the other and walked away but returned. The priest, who was the more imposing figure(a full head above Emil), kept saying “no,” waving his hands wildly and shaking his head. They turned away from each other but came together and shook hands and seemed satisfied.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Grazia (the woman on the ground) was awake, but drifting away, and with the little strength she had left in her body, she pleaded for her husband. Amaria lied, saying the doctor was on his way, though she could make no promise. Santo and Luca had disappeared, and for a minute I thought they had left me alone, but they stood off in a stand of trees by the guard shack. Luca was smoking, while Santo took a piss, and I was never less proud of the two.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The woman sobbed, as if she knew this was to be her last moment on earth.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Please find my husband. *<i class="calibre5">Bernardo Deluca</i>...he is in...” and she stopped and shuddered from a wave of pain. “My God,” she cried, “I know my ankle is broken...what will I do?”  Emil and the priest returned and Patri declared in his loud, commanding voice, that he would take charge of the poor woman, as an act of mercy. “God willing, I will get the help she needs.”  Amaria kissed her rosary beads and hugged her children. She thanked the priest, asking on the circumstances that caused him to change his mind. He looked straight at her and smiled.  </p>
<p id="page_400" class="calibre6">“You, signura. I was touched by your faith, as I have not been touched before. I am ashamed I did not act sooner to help this suffering woman.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">He looked at me and snapped his fingers. “You there,” he said, with his cold stare, “Go and fetch the guard at the shack,” and he pointed the way, should I not be able to find the only shack on the dock, and in plain sight. “Tell him Patri Amita wants him here,” as he tapped his foot on a spot close to where the fallen woman lay.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Vai…vai…go,” he said. “Do not linger. Tell him I want him now, not tomorrow. This poor woman is suffering, and we all have a duty to her and our God to help.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He ordered me straight out, like an officer, and I did not like officers, but neither did I hate officers like Luca hated them. I was a better Catholic than a soldier, and she was suffering; if I could help, even a little, I would feel better about this day. I walked calmly, at first, to show I was not bullied by the priest. Was it her fault this man is a cavone?  I ran hard the rest of the way, and when I mentioned Patri to the guard, he crushed his cigarette against the shack, and moved like his ass was on fire, making a dead run for the spot, while trying to sling his rifle over his shoulder at the same time. He near lost it in the drink when he tripped over a loose rock. When he met the priest, they were like cousins, and embraced. It seems the Patris brother was a major, who commanded the army garrison near <i class="calibre5">Villa San Giovanni</i>.  This derelict of a soldier  knew his place.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Stay with this woman,” he ordered the soldier, who nodded at attention. “I will ask *<i class="calibre5">Mother Superior Emiliana</i> to bring the Sisters of Charity.” He paused. “They were given medical training in Africa…<i class="calibre5">Si</i>, Somalia. They will tend to her until the doctor returns from the hills.” The soldier obeyed without question, taking a position next to the woman, rifle at his side. Amaria asked Patri for his blessing before he left. He raised his hands. We kneeled, except Luca, who walked away, as I expected he would do.      </p>
<p id="page_401" class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritūs Sancti</i>... in the name of the Father, the Son… </p>
<p class="calibre6">“May God be with you,” he said, finishing his blessing. “Mother Superior will be here shortly, and you can leave, knowing you have helped one of Gods children.” Amaria bowed in front of the priest, and nudged at her children, who bowed, though they had little interest in it all.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Patri turned to leave. I asked, “The train, Patri? How do we find the train?”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, si, the train.” He pointed to a narrow street across from the docks.  “<i class="calibre5">Via Mazzoli</i>,” he said. “Take it north for two or three blocks. You will come on men with wagons for hire. Give them a few lire and they will take you to the next station. Maybe five or six miles. Whoever you hire, tell him I have sent you. Patri Amita.” He held up a finger and stopped. “This is important. They will treat you right and you will not be cheated. Now, God bless you all,” and with this he crossed the road and turned the corner and disappeared. The last we saw was the tip of his long cassock snapping in the wind. That was that, thank God.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Grazia, near delirious from the pain, asked if the man in black was a priest, or did she imagine it, or was there a man and he was not dressed in black, or there was no one, and she imagined it all? She wanted to give her confession, if he was a priest.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria rubbed the woman’s arm. “He is a priest. But now he is gone.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Grazia cried in pain when she tried to move her leg and the shrillness of it caused Santo and Luca looked away.  </p>
<p id="page_402" class="calibre6">“I must be in the state of grace…please…if he is a priest bring him back to hear my confession. I cannot die with sin on my soul.” Amaria calmed her by rubbing her forehead.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazia, I am sorry, but the priest is gone. The Sisters of Charity will come and nurse you until the dottore comes back from the hills.”  Grazia trembled and cried the harder.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will burn in hell. I need the priest…why did you let him go?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He went for help. He will send the nurses, the sisters, and you will not die.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">She pleaded with Amaria. “Find my husband. I told him not to go…they went ahead to Napoli, for work, to make money for the tickets to America. He said he was tired of being poor. It scared me when he said it. I never knew what he would do.” She stopped and waited for the pain to pass. “He is a good man, hardworking. All day, everyday…whatever it…”  She gritted her teeth, and she gave a look that might be pain or a smile, but I am certain it was pain. She gasped and coughed. “We were too far back in the rent to catch up. The drought. Two years long. Nothing would grow…the pain…I am sorry…bad crops…no money for anything. There is a shack in the woods...owned by the landlord. My husband and son went there at night and took a small plow and a few tools.” She coughed. “He sold them for food money…what else could he do? ‘We must go to America,’ he said.” She grated her teeth so hard, I thought they would break off in her mouth. “The landlord knew. He accused my son and husband…said he would call the Carribieneri. They hid in the woods, but a good neighbor warned them, and they fled to Napoli. They would find work and I would join them.  I am ashamed of what we did. It is forever a black mark on my family, but there was no way out for us.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria took a small water flask from her bag and held it to Grazia’s lips, and she took a long drink, most of it running from her mouth, onto the ground. “*Signuri Moro is an evil man, always cursing, mostly the Lord’s name in vain. He knew we stole from him, and he said it; I am so ashamed.” She closed her eyes and threw back her head and her body tensed, then shook.   </p>
<p id="page_403" class="calibre6">“God, help me,” she pleaded.  “This is my punishment…I need the priest.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I remember this clearly, that they stole to survive, and to that point I heard nothing wrong, as they had no choice, but to take from a man who had too much.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The Carabinieri… they came and searched our shack and found nothing. They threatened me with a beating, ‘or more,’ and the tall cop screamed it in my face.  I expected the beating they promised, but I feared ‘the more’ like death. They only punched me a few times and knocked me to the floor. The landlord cursed and demanded the Carabinieri be tougher.”  They threatened prison but would not give up her husband and son, and the Carribieneri tired and left.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">She begged forgiveness for the trouble she caused.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will understand if you leave me to die,” and once she started cleansing her conscience,  she could not stop confessing.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My cousin' <i class="calibre5">Giovanna Martucco</i> and her husband, Enrico, a good man, brought me across the hills to Messina in their mule cart. Two nights in the woods. I was frightened. I wanted to die, but I wanted to see my son and husband more.” She turned her head and grabbed at her hair and pulled. “My God, this pain. I cannot stand it anymore…I want to die.” Her eyes closed and she was quiet and nothing on her body moved, as I could see. I was frightened for her. I looked closer to see if she was breathing. Yes, but barely.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria shook her, gently.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazia. Do not sleep.” She opened her eyes, and they moved, side to side, but her head did not move. Did she know where she was and why she was on the ground, I wondered. Why were we staring at her? She followed me with her eyes as I moved and stood behind Amaria, who was still kneeling, tending to her.   </p>
<p id="page_404" class="calibre6">“Si, yes, I remember. I slipped…the sound…the pain.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You broke your ankle, bad,” I said. She stared at me and coughed. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Will I live?” she asked. Who will answer this question? Not me. Amaria took her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You said your cousin brought you to Messina?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, the plow…now I remember.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do not speak if it is too much.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, I must speak,” she said, her voice weak. “It might keep me alive, but I do not think so.”  She looked at me and Emil, standing over her, and she must have felt like a child, or an elderly woman, who no longer had any control of her life.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Giovanna and her husband saved me from prison. Wonderful people, but I will never see them again. I hope they are safe.”  She clenched her teeth; her face was white, and she held her breath and strained, then relaxed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The pain is unbearable…but you must know this. My son is innocent, but he is a marked man for life, for no reason. He did nothing. He is just a hothead like his father. I know they will fight if they are cornered and they will end up dead or in prison if they come for me, and I will die anyway. If you know where they are, tell them to stay away.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria moved the hair that had fallen into Grazia eyes and wiped her forehead.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Grazia coughed, but thanked her for the kindness.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was foolishness to think we could find her husband and son in Napoli, on the docks. Craziness. The woman was right, and for all her suffering and pain, she thought clearly. If her husband and son came for her, they will be put in prison, or worse. But Emil, the good man he is, promised he would look in Napoli, and she reached and grabbed his hand and thanked him for his kindness. She described her husband and son; both average men, Sicilian farmers. The son was *Antonino, a head taller than his father. “He has beautiful red hair, like fire. My father’s hair. He will stand out in a crowd. He says his hair is his curse.” She wanted to smile, she tried.     </p>
<p id="page_405" class="calibre6">Red hair? There is not a strand of red hair on any man in my village, or any place I have been in Italia. I have seen blond heads, a few in Sicilia, but never red. I felt better about the promise; at least from a mile away, we will see his red hair. Emil knelt and took her hand.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. We will ask in Napoli, but I promise nothing.” She thanked him, as well as she could with the pain and the loss of blood that soaked the ground around her.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He tried to explain, but his wife said no, and he let it go. It was over, except for the Sisters of Charity, who had not showed, if they were coming at all. In a few minutes it would be honorable for us to leave and find our train. Emil thanked me for my help, and took my shoulders and we hugged, and he called me friend. Friend. He called me friend.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria cleaned her as best she could, as we waited on the Sisters of Charity to take charge and see to her care, that we were promised. She asked for a knife to cut away the blood-soaked stocking that covered the woman’s ankle. The soldier (we never knew his name) took out a filthy, and slightly rusted field knife from his belt. Amaria cleaned it with a good rag soaked in sea water and cut away the stocking. The mangled ankle was black, swollen a hundred times over, like a carcass left in the sun. What blood could she have left in her body? The sight of it sickened me, and my stomach churned inside my body, and I thought for certain I would throw up in front of everyone. But no, I did not. We waited for near an hour, maybe longer, and no sisters. Grazia was still alive, and I laid to the power of prayer, even from a <i class="calibre5">cavone</i>, Patri Amita. The soldier was of no use, except he stood guard over a half dead woman, but I am certain he saw this as a measure of his worth, along with the cigarettes he smoked, and two stogeys.   </p>
<p id="page_406" class="calibre6">‘I am going to die,” she said, and I believed it was true. Amaria rubbed her brow.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Have faith. The Sisters will come. Patri Amita, this good man has arranged for your care.” Grazia did not answer. In times of calamity and misfortune, mine and others, I have found I am only good for small talk; meaningless words that kill some time, while the better people do the work that needs to be done. I stood with Emil and his children and waited, and sometimes Emil paced, and his pacing made me nervous. I thought, make small talk, be useful, and wait for these Angels of Mercy, who are late, or not coming. The thought crossed my mind, that this priest would not do what he said he would do. In one breath he had no time, the next he could not do enough for this poor woman. What influence could Emil have over a man like Amita, a priest and an important man in the city. A tailor? He is a fine man, but a nothing, a nobody, like me, running away to America. What could he do for a powerful man like Amita?  Why would anyone pay him attention?  When I asked, he denied any influence, and I believed him, yet in the next breath he had little respect he had for the Church, especially after this day. But not so his wife, who was fervent in her belief that what a priest says is true, even if it is a lie. What sense did it make? Is a lie from a priest less a lie than a lie from a regular man?      </p>
<p class="calibre6">I heard a feint sound I believed was the clatter of a mule cart. Emil looked over my shoulder and was the first to see it, and he was pleased and said good things about this priest. “He sent the help he promised,” Emil said, appearing happy it was almost over. Amaria had smiles all over, and she was more beautiful than before. Moving slowly over the cobblestone street, two young and husky nuns walked next to a cart, driven by an old man, who sucked on a cigar and still talked to his mule, that was not mangy, to my surprise. We might still be saved, I thought, feeling more the selfish man than a Christian. The older of the two nuns, but not Mother Superior, knelt beside the fallen woman and made the sign of the cross. She looked at the broken and jagged ankle bone, so dismayed by what see saw, that she pulled on the beads that hung from her black sash and kissed the crucifix and made the sign of the cross.            </p>
<p id="page_407" class="calibre6">“You have been injured seriously, signora,” the nun said, but calmly and with sympathy in her voice. “With Gods help, we will care for you at the convent, at the request of Patri Amita, who is a good man and a good priest.” She looked at Grazia, who might have been asleep, and slapped her face, gently. “Can you hear me?” she said, but Grazia only moaned and babbled on about the plow, and how her soul will rot in hell. “Hell?” the nun asked her. “Why do you speak about hell? A woman should always be in the state of grace.” The nun poked at the swollen ankle and Grazia let out a cry of pain that startled the gulls, and a hundred took off into the air, and a few circled. The guard complained about the bird shit, declaring his job was done, and he promptly headed back to the security of his shack. We lifted Grazia onto the cart, and from the prodding and jostling, she begged for mercy. The good nun rubbed her forehead.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You will be better in the convent, but you know the break is bad.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Grazia stared at the nun. “Are you the priest?” she asked. “If you are the priest, I am begging you for the Last Rights of the Church.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am a nun,” the sister replied. “Father Amita is not here. He is gone on appointments.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Please,” she begged, “I want the Last Rights of the Church.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Poor woman,” the nun whispers quietly, but we all heard her. Amaria straightened Grazia’s dress, that was soaked in blood and near dried.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am certain these good nuns will find a priest for you,” she said, as we placed Grazia on a fresh pile of hay, something like a mattress. I recall how good the fresh hay smelled. As the cart pulled away, Amaria walked with it a few steps, waved and wiped the tears from her eyes. “<i class="calibre5">Buona fortuna</i>,” she said to Grazia, and “<i class="calibre5">Che Dio ti benedica</i> (May God bless you).” </p>
<p id="page_408" class="calibre6"> Grazia raised her head a few inches from the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My husband,” she pleaded, barely able to speak, “tell him I am going to die. He should not come looking for me…but go on to America with our son. He will fight it, but tell him if he loves me, he will do it.” The old man snapped at the reins and the cart sped up; I hear Grazia asking for her hat, that fell into the sea. The cart pulled up and stood waiting. I walked to the water’s edge, where the hat was floating, but it was gone. Sunk, no doubt. I turn to the nun and shook my head, and she tapped the drivers shoulder; he snapped at the reins and they went on.  Amaria gathered her children who had wandered toward the water; together they kneeled looking at the sea and offered a prayer of thanks to God. She cried for a woman she did not know, because the woman suffered and her family would never know how she died or where she died, or that she wanted them to go on without her, out of love. Emil comforted his wife. What could he say? She was stricken by this compassion for the suffering of others. I sympathized with her, as I saw these feelings in my brother, Salvatore, who suffered from it all his life. I believe it is a terrible burden. Emil called to his son, Giovanni, and they gathered their bags and set them in a pile. Emil stood for a moment, smiling, admiring the sea. “Beautiful,” he said. “I never realized the sea held such beauty. I have always loved the mountains. Now I think I might love the sea more. What do you think Antonino?”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is beautiful,” I said, but I have seen the sea many times.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But tell me this? The priest? Amita? What did you say that lit a good fire under his ass?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil hesitated and glanced toward his wife, who still prayed with her children.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">He took me by the arm and squeezed. “Do you swear not to tell another soul?” </p>
<p id="page_409" class="calibre6">“I do not…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you swear?” he asked again. “Especially Amaria.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not a word. I swear it.” He leaned and covered his mouth and speaking in a whisper, “I gave the sonofabitch money,” and he smiled, not showing a scrap of shame. “Sixty lire for the poor box, near everything we had. He swore it would go to the poor box.” He pulled me away a few more steps. “But I am no fool,” he said, “the poor have a better chance of being rich than seeing a lira of it. But it is done and over and we can move on.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sixty lire? You bribed a priest?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil put his hands in front of his face, backing away from me. “I have bribed no one,” he said. “It is for the poor. An agreement between men. Take it or leave it, I said. Thirty lire now, and thirty lire when I see the cart. He ripped the thirty from my hand. The other thirty when she is on her way to the Church. I give it to the driver, and he asked me ‘is it for the poor box, or the church building fund, as it mattered on what pocket Patri used.’ That is what he said., but I knew as much.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sixty lire? You give that sonofabitch sixty lire.?” Emil nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “He wanted a hundred.” I laughed, then we laughed together.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But you are correct, he is a thief, pure and simple. I said sixty, take it or leave it. The woman is nothing to me. When he took the first thirty, he laughed. ‘Then the poor will have to do without,’ he said. I thought to laugh in his face, but I could not, as I have respected priests and never thought one of them capable of selling their  services, like common puttanu…si, common puttanu.” He looked at the sea and sighed. “I am sorry to say, we are near broke. There are only have a few lire left. It is all we have in the world.” He scrubbed his foot along the ground, “but we will survive. We are going to America. This keeps me going…gives me hope. I did what I had to do.”  </p>
<p id="page_410" class="calibre6">“But remember, Antonino, you promise never to say a word to my wife. Much has happened to shake Amaria’s faith in God.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I gave you my word, my right hand to God.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I know what I said, what I promised, and I meant it when I said it, but sooner or later, I would tell someone; Luca or Santo, or the both.  And now I have broken my promise, as I am telling you, but I know you will never repeat it to a soul.  </p>
