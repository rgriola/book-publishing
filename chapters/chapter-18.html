<!-- Trapped in the ship's iron belly, the protagonist faces the stifling reality of steerage, enduring filthy air, boredom, and mounting fear of the voyage.-->

<h3 style="font-style: italic;">Lost in the Corridors</h3>
<p>We tramped through the corridors in search of home, but we tired fast, our legs burned. We knew we were lost in those goddamned iron caves. We walked for hours, so it seemed, but most likely no more than an hour, maybe two. Home? I said home, but it was not home, and it could never be home.</p>
<p>We made a left and a few rights, up a long, iron staircase, down another, and a definite wrong turn; another wrong turn and we were there, but by accident, not from some well thought out plan. The door was open, the room was quiet, except grunting noises and cursing from the toilette. Where did they all go? I worried, that maybe they were allowed on deck, that it was all a bad rumor, and they went up, and they enjoyed the sun, or they all fell overboard, as the boat was rocking from the waves, and we were left behind. In any case, they were gone, not here and maybe they were in a better place.</p>
<p>We hear cursing from the shithouse, sounding from the vile mouth of a simple and lowly sailor, on his knees, cleaning the floor and smoking a stogie, blowing the smoke proudly and it made me gag. A <em>Sicilian</em> stogie, I believe. The evil smell of it covered the evil smell of the toilette, and that was good. <em>Saluto tutti</em>. I saluted them all, the cleaning man and all the men who made it to the top, if they did, or the ones who went over the side.</p>
<p>“To each his own,” <em>papa</em> says.</p>
<p>“<em>Buongiornu</em>,” I say politely to the sailor, and I admit it felt good saying pleasant words to a stranger, though he ignored me, and it did not make me angry. I am alive, therefore used to being ignored.</p>
<p>“So, you work the buckets,” I ask. He turned away. “I cannot remember the buckets of shit I have hauled in my life, but now I am going to America,” and at that he nodded, but otherwise showed little interest in what I said, or that were brothers, in a way.</p>
<p>“Our first stop? Do you know when?”</p>
<p>He spits on the floor and curses his place in the world, never looking up or acknowledging my question. Cleaning shithouses did not agree with him, but it was only a guess. I ask again, thinking, maybe, he did not hear me clear. He stared at me, this pitiful look on his face, and I believe he needed a shave.</p>
<p>“<em>Barcelona</em>,” he said. “In two days...or three days if the weather kicks up.”</p>
<p>He moved the bucket and rag, cursing a streak, not at me, but his place in the world. “How do we pass the time?” I ask. He was confused at my question.</p>
<p>“Time? What time?” he said, swinging his arm in an arc, across the floor, for some reason hitting his bucket and tipping it over. The mess spread across the iron floor, and he cursed me for bothering him, and at that instant the ship leaned, and this shitty mess flowed to the corner. Taking rags, he cleaned what he spilt, still cursing his place in the world. Who could blame him? Cleaning shit, even shit on the high seas, for its adventure, was a foul, indecent way to make a living. He was fast, though, and skilled at what he did, as it took him only seconds to wipe the floor clean. He groaned a little, as he stood to admire his work, but bitched about a spot he missed, as he dropped down and tried to scrub through the metal plate.</p>
<p>What man can take pride in cleaning shit off the floor? “Your question?” he said. “Passing the time.”</p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>. To ease this boredom. Two weeks of…”</p>
<p>He stopped me with a flick of his hand, and I believe he had enough of me and questions.</p>
<p>“Go aft,” he said, pointing to the back of the ship. “There is a room, a big room. You can sit and play cards and drink until you go blind. Find a table, stay put, until they throw you out…and they will. Last crossing, a few men slept in the chairs three straight nights and the guards threatened to club them unless they went back to their cabin.”</p>
<p>This is the solution? How long can a sane man play <em>brìscula</em>? And we have no wine. How long have we been here? More than a day? Maybe two days, and if it has been two days, I have missed a meal.</p>

<h3 style="font-style: italic;">Complaints and Consequences</h3>

<p>He said aft, I think. The back of the boat? He should have said back.</p>
<p>“We have been there already. Tables and chairs.” He shrugged his shoulders. “Will we see the sun this trip?” I ask, and he outright laughed in my face.</p>
<p>“All the sun you want if you can see through an inch of iron plate.”</p>
<p>“So, we are prisoners down here?” He shrugged, again, caring little about my difficulty. “It is what it is,” he said and turned his back to me and scrubbed a little more.</p>
<p>“What is your suggestion?” I ask. He stared at me, more through me.</p>
<p>“What do you want me to say?” he said, more laughing in my face and I felt the fool. “If I was anybody, would I be on my knees, like some <em>puttanu</em>?”</p>
<p>We are what I feared, trapped in an iron coffin, and when I breathed hard, a severe pain went up my spine, into my shoulder, down my arm, and burning like hell fire. My bones, my joints creaked and cracked, like a god damned old man. I eased myself onto the bed, gasping in pain, and what I remember to this day is the stink of the blankets, but I did not recall the stink in the morning. Some <em>cavone</em>, I believe, traded my clean blankets for his filthy blankets, when we left the cabin. I lay there, for maybe a minute and could take it no more. I was losing my mind, or it was already lost, and how would I know?</p>
<p>We go back to the sailor and <em>Enzo</em> complained and for some reason(maybe his own boredom) he listened.</p>
<p>“This is not what you promised,” <em>Enzo</em> said, angry and stuttering. “Promised?” The sailor scowled and spit into the bucket.</p>
<p>“I promised you shit…nothing. Am I a man who owns ships, or makes promises?” “No, <em>signuri</em>. I did not mean you promised it, yourself. The <em>Corriere della Sera</em>. Do you know that newspaper?”</p>
<p>“I have heard of it,” he said, as he bent over and set his bucket on the floor. <em>Enzo</em> moved closer and I see the sailor getting nervous. <em>Enzo</em> cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“Your company solicits passengers in newspaper ads,” he tells the sailor, still stuttering and spitting the words. The sailor stepped back, away from <em>Enzo</em>.</p>
<p>“Solicit?(<em>sollecitare</em>) What does it mean?”</p>
<p>“Solicit? Well, it is like selling to fill the boats. You make promises you do not intend to keep, in this case, the promise that we will have room to move and stretch…fresh air, good food. I repeat this from memory; it is what your advertisement said.” The sailor pokes <em>Enzo’s</em> shoulder and clenches his right fist.</p>
<p>“I said it. I said nothing. I said shit. This is what I promised you,” and <em>Enzo</em> wisely backed away from this hothead.</p>
<p>“Why tell me?” he asked <em>Enzo</em>. “Tell it to a goddamn officer.” He drops to the floor, hitting it hard, flinching from the pain. He was no young man, but he took his job serious as I could see. I watched him rub furiously at a spot of grease (or another foul contaminant) until it was gone. He groaned, pushing himself up from the floor. “Find an officer,” he says, “give him your list of complaints.” He laughed hard at a joke only he could see.</p>
<p>“Say to him ‘<em>Enrico Fasullo</em> sent you.’ They know me.” All bullshit. He smiled.</p>

<h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Price of Freedom</h3>

<p>Two more weeks. If I say it over and over; two more weeks, two more weeks, maybe I will get used to it, like a stone in the boot. <em>Papa</em> always believed a man can get used to anything, even things that kill you. I was born on a brutal hot day, while <em>mama</em> walked to the fields with <em>papa’s</em> bread and wine. She covered my face with a cloth, against the sun, but I cried until she took it away. This is how she remembers that day, how I loved the sun, and the heat, as soon as I saw it and felt it, and when I was a man, even when I curse it because it cooked me like a piece of meat on the grate.</p>
<p>“How can you remember your own birth?” you ask. “Is anything more important?” I reply.</p>
<p>Two more weeks. Only two more weeks.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon. I was tired, like an old mule, and I ached, but no one of us could sleep, not even <em>Enzo</em>, who was only bored, and not in pain and this hard to believe for a man of his age. A lucky old bastard, as I could see.</p>
<p>“What do you say, <em>Enzo</em>?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We should walk the corridors,” he said. “Explore the ship for our own edification (knowledge). Maybe it will help with the boredom.”</p>
<p><em>Mio Diu</em>. I called on the Almighty.</p>
<p>“Send through these steel plates a bolt of lightning and strike me dead. Be quick, so I do not suffer.” I repeated it in case He did not hear me the first time. No suffering, though. I have suffered enough with the rest of them. This one little favor, and I will never doubt You or take your name in vain. Never again.</p>
<p>“Here is a special gift for <em>Antonino Sparacino</em>, from Me, to ease his pain.”</p>
<p>After some time, they all came back to the cabin, these <em>stranieri</em>, as the rumor was there was no more food to be passed out, and there was no more to be had on the ship because someone made a mistake and not enough was brought on. It was like home. Never enough to eat. I will be honest and say now, that men were hoarding food for their family. Ten <em>lire</em>, if you had it, bought enough for the rest of the journey and fuck everyone else. We bought and hoarded and what we could not buy we stole in the night. I gave a little to the girl from <em>Colleberardi</em> and she promised to pray for me. This is all I will say about our crime.</p>
<p>I lay back, watching through half closed eyes, as the men left the warmth of the wool blankets and walked to the toilette and back, and I thought of joining them, for something to do. It was someplace between four and five in the afternoon, but I guessed, as I had no watch and no energy to ask <em>Enzo</em> the correct time. What did it matter? I could not sleep, and in some way, I was proud of it, as I believed only drunks and lazy men, and other good-for-nothings sleep before eight at night. Back home, it’s the middle of the workday and I should be picking, not on my back trying to sleep. What felt right? Nothing felt right. Is it yesterday, or two days from when we left, or is it tomorrow? <em>Enzo</em> believed boredom and confusion is a small price for our freedom, if there is freedom at the end, and if freedom is more than making a few more <em>lire</em> every month. He admitted this when I insisted on an answer, that he was not sure there would be good at the end. I wanted guarantees. Was this freedom only a promise, as they promised sun and fresh air and good food, and so far, I have seen none of it, except what we could steal.</p>
<p>I was suspicious of sleep, although I wanted it, I know I needed it. I was exhausted. <em>Enzo</em> recited this, like a poem, though he said it was not a poem, as it did not rhyme. <em>Noia</em>. Boredom. In <em>italiano</em>.</p>
<p><em>Ennui</em>. Boredom. In <em>francese</em>.</p>
<p><em>Langeweile</em>. Boredom. In <em>tedesco</em>. <em>Libertà</em>. Freedom. In <em>italiano</em>.</p>
<p><em>Libertè</em>. Freedom. In <em>francese</em>. <em>Freiheit</em>. Freedom. In <em>tedesco</em>.</p>
<p>This boredom is the price I pay for freedom, like <em>Enzo</em> says. Two weeks. Not two years. Not a lifetime. Be a man, <em>Antonino</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>I fell off to sleep. I believe I was sleeping. Maybe not.</p>
