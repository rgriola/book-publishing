<div class="chapter-body">

<p class="calibre4">We tramped through the corridors in search of home, but we tired fast, our legs burned. We  knew we were lost in those goddamned iron caves.  We walked for hours, so it seemed, but most likely no more than an hour, maybe two. Home? I said home, but it was not home, and it could never be home. </p>
<p class="calibre6">We made a left and a few rights, up a long, iron staircase, down another, and a definite wrong turn; another wrong turn and we were there, but by accident, not from some well thought out plan. The door was open, the room was quiet, except grunting noises and cursing from the toilette. Where did they all go?  I worried, that maybe they were allowed on deck, that it was all a bad rumor, and they went up, and they enjoyed the sun, or they all fell overboard, as the boat was rocking from the waves, and we were left behind. In any case, they were gone, not here and maybe they were in a better place.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">We hear cursing from the shithouse, sounding from the vile mouth of a simple and lowly sailor, on his knees, cleaning the floor and smoking a stogie, blowing the smoke proudly and it made me gag.   A Sicilian stogie, I believe. The evil smell of it covered the evil smell of the toilette, and that was good<i class="calibre5">. Saluto tutti</i>. I saluted them all, the cleaning man and all the men who made it to the top, if they did, or the ones who went over the side.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“To each his own,” papa says.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Buongiornu</i>,” I say politely to the sailor, and I admit it felt good saying pleasant words to a stranger, though he ignored me, and it did not make me angry. I am alive, therefore used to being ignored.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, you work the buckets,” I ask. He turned away.  “I cannot remember the buckets of shit I have hauled in my life, but now I am going to America,” and at that he nodded, but otherwise showed little interest in what I said, or that were brothers, in a way.         </p>
<p id="page_588" class="calibre6">“Our first stop? Do you know when?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He spits on the floor and curses his place in the world, never looking up or acknowledging my question. Cleaning shithouses did not agree with him, but it was only a guess. I ask again, thinking, maybe, he did not hear me clear. He stared at me, this pitiful look on his face, and I believe he needed a shave.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Barcelona</i>,” he said. “In two days...or three days if the weather kicks up.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He moved the bucket and rag, cursing a streak, not at me, but his place in the world.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How do we pass the time?” I ask. He was confused at my question.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Time? What time?” he said, swinging his arm in an arc, across the floor, for some reason hitting his bucket and tipping it over. The mess spread across the iron floor, and he cursed me for bothering him, and at that instant the ship leaned, and this shitty mess flowed to the corner. Taking rags, he cleaned what he spilt, still cursing his place in the world. Who could blame him? Cleaning shit, even shit on the high seas, for its adventure, was a foul, indecent way to make a living. He was fast, though, and skilled at what he did, as it took him only seconds to wipe the floor clean. He groaned a little, as he stood to admire his work, but bitched about a spot he missed, as he dropped down and tried to scrub through the metal plate.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">What man can take pride in cleaning shit off the floor?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your question?” he said. “Passing the time.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si</i>. To ease this boredom. Two weeks of…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He stopped me with a flick of his hand, and I believe he had enough of me and questions.   </p>
<p id="page_589" class="calibre6">“Go aft,” he said, pointing to the back of the ship. “There is a room, a big room. You can sit and play cards and drink until you go blind. Find a table, stay put, until they throw you out…and they will. Last crossing, a few men slept in the chairs three straight nights and the guards threatened to club them unless they went back to their cabin.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">This is the solution? How long can a sane man play <i class="calibre5">brìscula</i>? And we have no wine. How long have we been here? More than a day? Maybe two days, and if it has been two days, I have missed a meal.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He said <i class="calibre5">aft</i>, I think. The back of the boat?  He should have said <i class="calibre5">back</i>.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We have been there already. Tables and chairs.” He shrugged his shoulders.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Will we see the sun this trip?” I ask, and he outright laughed in my face.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“All the sun you want if you can see through an inch of iron plate.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, we <i class="calibre5">are</i> prisoners down here?” He shrugged, again, caring little about my difficulty.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is what it is,” he said and turned his back to me and scrubbed a little more.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What is your suggestion?” I ask. He stared at me, more through me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you want me to say?” he said, more laughing in my face and I felt the fool. “If I was anybody, would I be on my knees, like some <i class="calibre5">puttanu</i>.?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">We are what I feared, trapped in an iron coffin, and when I breathed hard, a severe pain went up my spine, into my shoulder, down my arm, and burning like hell fire. My bones, my joints creaked and cracked, like a god damned old man. I eased myself onto the bed, gasping in pain, and what I remember to this day is the stink of the blankets, but I did not recall the stink in the morning. Some cavone, I believe, traded my clean blankets for his filthy blankets, when we left the cabin. I lay there, for maybe a minute and could take it no more. I was losing my mind, or it was already lost, and how would I know?  </p>
<p id="page_590" class="calibre6">We go back to the sailor and Enzo complained and for some reason(maybe his own boredom) he listened.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This is not what you promised,” Enzo said, angry and stuttering.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Promised?” The sailor scowled and spit into the bucket.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I promised you shit…nothing. Am I a man who owns ships, or makes promises?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, signuri. I did not mean <i class="calibre5">you</i> promised it, yourself. The <i class="calibre5">Corriere della Sera. </i>Do you know that newspaper?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have heard of it,” he said, as he bent over and set his bucket on the floor. Enzo moved closer and I see the sailor getting nervous. Enzo cleared his throat.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your company solicits passengers in newspaper ads,” he tells the sailor, still stuttering and spitting the words. The sailor stepped back, away from Enzo.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Solicit</i>?(s<i class="calibre5">ollecitare) </i>What does it mean?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Solicit</i>? Well, it is like selling to fill the boats. You make promises you do not intend to keep, in this case, the promise that we will have room to move and stretch…fresh air, good food. I repeat this from memory; it is what your advertisement said.” The sailor pokes Enzo’s shoulder and clenches his right fist.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I said it. I said nothing. I said shit. This is what I promised you,” and Enzo wisely backed away from this hothead.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why tell me?” he asked Enzo. “Tell it to a goddamn officer.” He drops to the floor, hitting it hard, flinching from the pain. He was no young man, but he took his job serious as I could see. I watched him rub furiously at a spot of grease (or another foul contaminant) until it was gone. He groaned, pushing himself up from the floor.  “Find an officer,” he says, “give him your list of complaints.” He laughed hard at a joke only he could see.  </p>
<p id="page_591" class="calibre6">“Say to him *’<i class="calibre5">Enrico Fasullo</i> sent you.’ They know me.” All bullshit. He smiled.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Two more weeks. If I say it over and over; two more weeks, two more weeks, maybe I will get used to it, like a stone in the boot. Papa always believed a man can get used to anything, even things that kill you. I was born on a brutal hot day, while mama walked to the fields with papa’s bread and wine. She covered my face with a cloth, against the sun, but I cried until she took it away. This is how she remembers that day, how I loved the sun, and the heat, as soon as I saw it and felt it, and when I was a man, even when I curse it because it cooked me like a piece of meat on the grate.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How can you remember your own birth?” you ask.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is anything more important?” I reply.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Two more weeks. Only two more weeks.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was late in the afternoon. I was tired, like an old mule, and I ached, but no one of us could sleep, not even Enzo, who was only bored, and not in pain and this hard to believe for a man of his age. A lucky old bastard, as I could see. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you say, Enzo?” I asked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We should walk the corridors,” he said. “Explore the ship for our own edification (knowledge). Maybe it will help with the boredom.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Mio Diu</i>. I called on the Almighty.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Send through these steel plates a bolt of lightning and strike me dead. Be quick, so I do not suffer.” I repeated it in case He did not hear me the first time. No suffering, though. I have suffered enough with the rest of them. This one little favor, and I will never doubt You or take your name in vain. Never again.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Here is a special gift for Antonino Sparacino, from Me, to ease his pain.” </p>
<p id="page_592" class="calibre6">After some time, they all came back to the cabin, these <i class="calibre5">stranieri, </i>as the rumor was there was no more food to be passed out, and there was no more to be had on the ship because someone made a mistake and not enough was brought on. It was like home. Never enough to eat. I will be honest and say now, that men were hoarding food for their family. Ten lire, if you had it, bought enough for the rest of the journey and fuck everyone else. We bought and hoarded and what we could not buy we stole in the night. I gave a little to the girl from Colleberardi and she promised to pray for me. This is all I will say about our crime.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I lay back, watching through half closed eyes, as the men left the warmth of the wool blankets and walked to the toilette and back, and I thought of joining them, for something to do. It was someplace between four and five in the afternoon, but I guessed, as I had no watch and no energy to ask Enzo the correct time. What did it matter? I could not sleep, and in some way, I was proud of it, as I believed only drunks and lazy men, and other good-for-nothings sleep before eight at night.  Back home, it’s the middle of the workday and I should be picking, not on my back trying to sleep. What felt right? Nothing felt right. Is it yesterday, or two days from when we left, or is it tomorrow? Enzo believed boredom and confusion is a small price for our freedom, if there is freedom at the end, and if freedom is more than making a few more lire every month. He admitted this when I insisted on an answer, that he was not sure there would be good at the end. I wanted guarantees. Was this freedom only a promise, as they promised sun and fresh air and good food, and so far, I have seen none of it, except what we could steal.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was suspicious of sleep, although I wanted it, I know I needed it. I was exhausted.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo recited this, like a poem, though he said it was not a poem, as it did not rhyme.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Noia. Boredom. In italiano.  </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Ennui. Boredom. In francese.  </i></p>
<p id="page_593" class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Langeweile. Boredom. In tedesco.  </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Libertà. Freedom. In italiano.  </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Libertè. Freedom. In francese.  </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Freiheit. Freedom. In tedesco.  </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">This boredom is the price I pay for freedom, like Enzo says. Two weeks. Not two years. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Not a lifetime. Be a man, Antonino, I thought.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I fell off to sleep. I believe I was sleeping. Maybe not.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">There was this sound, like a mild wind, maybe off the mountains, and then I see this figure, surrounded by white light. It was she, a woman, I know, dressed in a plain and simple robe, a woman’s robe, or maybe a dress. I squint my eyes. Si, yes, it was a woman, or she looked like a woman, at least a figure of a woman; slim and beautiful. Young? Old? The white light blinded me, and I wanted to look away, but could not.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who are you,” I ask, shaking, trembling, like some coward, thinking maybe it was religious, like the angel of death was here to take me to hell(because of my sins). But I see no wings, thank God and all angels have wings in any picture I have seen. I see a woman, and the robe was a dress. She waved her finger, like mama did when I was a child, after some offense I did that made her angry.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why did you leave us, <i class="calibre5">Antonino</i>. Answer me. Why did you leave us?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Carmela? Is it you, Carmela?” If it is Carmela, I did not understand her anger. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“When I left, we embraced, and you cried and wished me well and safe journey. ‘I will pray for you, every day, to Sant’Agata. ‘Every day,’ you said. It was your promise to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I hear talking, or it was the wind. </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Is it you, Carmela?” I ask, afraid of the answer.  </p>
<p id="page_594" class="calibre6">“Why did you do this to me?” she said, as the wind kicked up.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are starving. Our family is starving…it is your family, too.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who are you? If you are Carmela, you said I did the right thing.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I said no such thing. You have always been stubborn. You were a stubborn child.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tell me who you are or leave. I cannot stand this anymore.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am no one to you, it seems to me,” and she turned her back and walked into the light, talking softly, but I could hear her say, “Better to starve with your family than eat alone.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The figure grew dim and faint and withered away, like a thin, white cloud, scattered by the wind. Like a pig in the sun, I sweated, and the sweat ran into my eyes and burned. I wiped them with the sleeve of my shirt, and when I could see, I saw a woman, her dress crisp and clean, fit for Sunday Mass in the Cathedral.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Che bella figura</i>.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “How are you, <i class="calibre5">Antonino</i> ?  You look well,” she said. A young woman and I was flattered she knew my name.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How am I? Still alive,” I said, following her figure, as it floated above me, too far away to touch. I would touch her if I could touch her. At this time, what was shame?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you miss me? Do you love me?” She came closer. I reached and felt for her, like a blind man feeling along a wall, but I felt only air. She was here and there, but not here and there at the same time. Is this Carmela coming to me in a dream? Or was it…?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will stay pure for you. It is my promise.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I lifted my tired head from the pillow, and I ached.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Please, speak louder. I do not hear good in my dreams…if this a dream?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Antonino</i>, you are so far from home. The women? There are hundreds.” </p>
<p id="page_595" class="calibre6">“You <i class="calibre5">are</i> Carmela. I swear there has been no woman since we met in the field shack. The storm? You remember. The storm. Giovanna was afraid of me.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">We laughed together, and I knew it was her.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The storm, it was a gift from God,” she said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are too fine, too beautiful to disrespect,” I said. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You think I am beautiful?” She laughs. “Will you think I am beautiful when you see the American women. Will I be just a Sicilian girl you once knew, who carried stones on her  head?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I reached for her, hoping I might touch her body.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I could never think that of you like that.” She leaned. We touched hands. That is all. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Hands. I swear it to God. What to do if she comes closer? What is the rule? She is not here, so what do the rules mean, if there are rules for dreams? Anything I think is right is right for this moment.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are a man. It is different for men. Men are not faithful, or do they love like women love. Men are little more than animals, mama says. But not you.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“There has only been you.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And the young girl in the cabin? The girl from Colleberardi?  Do you love her?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I do not know her. I have not said a word to her. Why do you…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I know what you are thinking about her. Please do not lie to me.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I asked, “What are you doing now, at this moment?” I wanted to talk about something different. I see her, but I was dreaming, so she was not what I saw, or I did not see her. I was confused. If I was dreaming that I was dreaming, then maybe she was there?   </p>
<p id="page_596" class="calibre6">“I must know. I need to touch you, if you are you, but you are floating, or I think you are floating. Are you dead? Tell me you are not dead.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Me and Giovanna, we are working hard with papa, picking stone for a house he is building near signuri <i class="calibre5">*Bacci’s</i> lemon orchard. Papa says things are better in Messina. When he drinks too much wine, he says he will take us away. I do not like this talk I hear from him.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">I marveled at the spirit, thinking she <i class="calibre5">might</i> be Carmela.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Since I am gone from there, what does your father say about me?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“That you are a dreamer. Will I ever see you again?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He is afraid I will take you away, and he will lose you forever. That’s all.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">She floated closer and the air became colder, and I clearly heard the wind.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What are you doing?” she asks. “I see fog. Who can see through the fog.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sleeping. In the afternoon. Like a good for nothing.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am not really there. You know that? But I am Carmela, if you want me to be.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I knew it was you.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have been so tired since you are gone. When will you return?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“When I come back, we will marry…go back to America if it is a better place.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">She turned to the light, that was behind her, and nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Papa is calling. He will be angry I came here…you know what he will think.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I pleaded, “stay a few more minutes,” but she left, disappeared, if she was ever there.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Of course, she was there. I am sure of it. She said it was her.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">A voice, that seemed off in the distance, frightened me.  </p>
<p id="page_597" class="calibre6">Who are you talking to?” the voice said (I believe it was Carmella), but I tried to ignore it, by pulling the blanket over my head, as I was freezing cold, like I had fallen asleep in a snowbank. If I did, we were in America.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I hear a weak, stuttering voice, “Antonino, <i class="calibre5">wake up…</i>I have to tell you…”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Groggy and trembling, I rubbed my eyes, as I stare at the peeling paint on the iron walls. What was I doing here, wherever I was? The stuttering voice was Luca’s, and by his look and the sweat on his forehead, he just saw his own death and was not pleased by it. I sat up and rubbed my swollen eyes, that ached and bled water.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What is the matter? Your face is white…like a ghost.” He stood silent, as he stared down at me, but then he knelt close, too close for two men and I pushed back as far as I could. The cabin was near empty, thank God; no one saw him.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Troppo femminile (too much the female).</i></p>
<p class="calibre6">“You look too much like shit,” I said. “And shit looks bad.” I tried to laugh, but the aches and pains knocked hell out of me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Conte</i>. This bastard, he…”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Two men, stranieri<i class="calibre5">(foreign looking men)</i>, walked through the open door, and Luca froze. He waited as they wandered into the toilette and shut the door.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Conte</i> is a fucking bandit,” Luca said. “And not to be trusted.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A bandit? Did he beat you at cards?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No jokes,” he said, and I hear grim in his voice, that was not usual for Luca. “You know what I mean. He is a brigand…a thief…maybe a murderer.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He told you he was brigand…a murderer?” I sounded like a fool, so I shut my mouth.     </p>
<p id="page_598" class="calibre6">He told this story about this pitiful bastard who whistled too much and upset Conte, who does not like noise; he trips this poor bastard as he walked by, and Conte leans down, his face in the man’s face and demands, ‘get me a drink…and one for my friend, speaking of Luca. This cavone protests from his spot on the floor, but Conte only laughed, then gives a look to scare a saint, even a dead man, and the sonofabitch melts into wet shit. This was Luca’s story.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Never stare at that bastard’s eyes,” Luca said. “They burn through you like a <i class="calibre5">fulmine</i> (lightning bolt).” The cabin started to fill up. Two men, both haggard, tired looking, stopped and one stared and they both nodded, as if I knew them, but I did not. Luca made a move and I believe he meant to throw them back into the corridor, but I took his arm and stopped him.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Forget them. What is the matter with you?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca was breathing heavy, like a man running up a long hill, and I expected him to collapse in front of me.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si</i>, I should forget them all. You are right.” He tried to calm himself. When he shakes his head, the beads of sweat flew from his face, like a dog shedding water after a swim across the stream. This is what I remember about that night…stupid things.  Luca clears his throat and coughs.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What was I saying?” He thought for a few seconds. “Si, this poor cavone that Conte tripped struggled to get off the floor, and he lost his balance and fell over some goddamned stool in the way. He righted himself and went off looking for water. He comes back with a single cup, pleading it was all he could find. No wine. No grappa. He was shaking. Me? I felt sorry for him. He had nothing for me, and Conte was pissed. ‘What about my friend, here,’ he said, looking at me. I wanted to crawl through the cracks in the floor. Conte orders him to leave, throwing insults. He curses, saying the water was stale…dirty…he was too slow…and in the middle of his cursing, he looks me in the eye, ‘you will work for me in America,’ he said.    ‘What?’ is all I could say, stuttering like a fool, as I hear him say he will get even with the ‘fucking Americans’ for throwing him out of their country, and treating him like a common criminal. He has work for me <i class="calibre5">before </i>we get to America. Easy work. Clean work, that will be to my liking.”      </p>
<p id="page_599" class="calibre6">“This is what was said to you? Every word? He said it to you?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Every word of it. I will collect money owed him and beat the men who do not pay. This is the job, and I take it, or else.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Or else? Those were the words he used. ‘Or else?’” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si</i>. Or else.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I leaned to Luca. “Why you? Did he pick your name out of a hat?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca shook his head. “No. Not at all. Some <i class="calibre5">cavone</i> told him I am a man who should not be crossed. That I can take care of myself.” He stops and checks the cabin. “In my mind I say it was this fucking schoolteacher you brought along.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why would he do it?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Because. It is too simple. He is too educated and spiteful. Spiteful like a woman.” This fear I had not seen in Luca, but I believe he was pissing in the wind, imagining most of what he told me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Enzo is jealous,” he said. “I believe it is because he is no man and does not fit in with men. I asked Conte where he got this information; he laughed and grabbed his ear. ‘A little bird he told me, laughing like a jackass. He repeats it. ‘<i class="calibre5">Un Uccilino</i>.’  I swear I will find this ‘little bird,’ and kick his ass to Napoli, or Sicilia, wherever he comes from.”  </p>
<p id="page_600" class="calibre6">“Enzo? You think Enzo?” I clench my fists; a nervous habit, as I am a violent man.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why would he? What is his gain? Not hate. He barely knows us. You must refuse Conte. Be honest. Say you will not work for a thug like him.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I see it in Luca’s eyes. He has no stomach for this fight.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Men like him do not accept refusals. ‘No one ever says ‘no’ to me,’ this is what he said. He asked about my family. I told him, like a fool. I should have stayed in <i class="calibre5">Sicilia. </i>Who am I? I should eat shit like everyone else. But no, not Luca. Luca is too good to eat shit. Now this bastard will kill me, kill my family, or have them all killed. What choice do I have?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I try soothing talk, that Conte was only shooting off his mouth, a big man in front of strangers, people who do not know him. But these bastards, they have long arms, their own arms and the arms they hire, like Luca, if he is stupid enough to sell his soul to a thug.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ignore him. Never refuse him, but never agree.” This I recommended, boldly, like a brave man would do, but I was not in Conte sights, and I felt the fool once I said it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If he is powerful, like he says, he would have brought men with him, instead of counting on luck to find someone along the way. Why not two men?  Maybe we are wrong. Maybe he is all talk. A bullshitter. I admit he has the look of a thug, how he rages and carries himself. But next to you, he is an old man…stand up to him. He looks tough, but I have seen you fight. You will kick his ass back to Sicilia.” Luca cleared his throat and loosened his collar; he was breathing hard, like a sick man and I admit I felt sorry for him.  He wanted to say something more, but the words stuck in his throat, coming out, finally in a stutter. I near fell to the floor.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My pistol. He has my pistol.” His words hung in the air. I stared at him, and he stared at me, then lowered his eyes, and looked away.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“That god damned pistol…I knew there was more.” I took his arm. “How did he get it?”  </p>
<p id="page_601" class="calibre6">“How did he get it? I gave it to him.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You gave it to him? You just gave a gun to that sonofabitch?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was excited and scared, I admit, so I shouted and every man and boy in the cabin turned, but as they were all good Siciliani, their instinct was to ignore what they heard, to mind their business, so they glanced and looked away, even the children. Two young and fit looking men, stopped what they were doing, fixing clothes, or some such menial task, and left the cabin without a word. Behind the two were a father and his son, and the father near dragged the boy along the floor, apologizing as he passed that what he heard, he heard by accident and it was already forgotten as soon as he heard it, and he swore he would never repeat what he forgot, or would his son remember a word of what he forgot. The rest of the cabin, including a few women, and the girl from <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi</i>, also left and we were alone.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca’s face was red from strain, and I thought the blood would seep through his skin.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We talked about pistols…small talk. I told him about the army and my wounds and how I was near death. ‘It means less than nothing to me,’ he said. ‘In Italia if you piss standing up, you have been in the army.’ He looks at my eye and laughed. ‘You only need one good eye,’ he said. I was angry, but what could I say. He knew I had the pistol. He knew everything. The little bird. The fucking little bird. Conte was going to bring his own gun, but he was afraid of a search when he came on the boat. It happened before.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What if they searched you?” he asked me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I never worry about what might happen.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">‘<i class="calibre5">Bene, bene</i>,’ he said and pats my arm. “All the better. You are a bold man,’ and he poured me a shot of grappa. ‘I need a bold man like you.’ I liked what he said. When are we praised for what we do…when?  But he knew it all.” </p>
<p id="page_602" class="calibre6">“He <i class="calibre5">knew</i> you had it. Did I ask you to get rid of the gun before we got on the boat?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, I was going…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You stutter too much,” I said. “This is bad for you…bad for us. And you have not answered me. How did he get the gun?” The cabin was empty, but for me and Luca.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How did he get your gun?” I asked again. His face, now red and swollen, was covered in sweat. He looked away so as not to face me like a man.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He took it,” he said, his eyes pointing to the floor.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He took it?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. He took it. How could I leave it here, with all these cavones?  Who are they? Where are they from? Conte wanted to see it, that’s all. See it. He knew I had it. So, I pulled it out and handed it to him, and his eyes became wide, like moons. He stroked it, like it was a fine woman. I could not believe my tired eyes. ‘I need this,’ he said, and he went crazy over it, fast, as if he never saw a gun before…a thug who never saw a gun…that is how he acted.” Luca rubbed his hands across his knees. “Then, well…Conte stuffs the pistol in his back pocket, saying ‘grazie for this gift. I will put it to good use.’ Something like that.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You let him take from you? No fight, no protest? You let him have it?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How could I stop him?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I asked what man told Conte about the pistol?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo denied it and so did Santo, but it was a sight to see them squirm; one was a liar; no more than a lying bastard, as I could tell.  </p>
