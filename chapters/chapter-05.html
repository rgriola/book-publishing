<!-- The Mason's Daughter's Promise

A storm forces Antonino and Carmela to meet. He promises to ask her mason father for permission to court her.
-->
<div class="chapter-body"></div>

<p class="calibre4">I recall the day I met Carmela, face to face, though she had long been on my mind. I saw her many times walking the high path near the mountain, and this one day I thought she smiled as we passed and I stumbled, hitting my head against the *<i class="calibre5">Etruscan</i> wall, and the workers laughed, making me feel the fool.  I saw her many times on this road, although we never spoke, but I recall nodding politely, two, maybe three times. More a nod you give to a neighbor as you pass on the street. Luca said I am like a glove on her slender hand, and she has turned me inside out, even though not a word passed between us, and I cannot say if she laughed the day I fell. My brother Paolo says I am a fool of a man, that she is a child and too young for me, even in Sicilia. Six, seven years, is that a great difference? He wants her for himself. This I believed to be true.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Carmela is the oldest daughter of <i class="calibre5">Paolo Rao</i>, the other is <i class="calibre5">Giovanna</i>, younger and not as beautiful. The Sicilian tradition is clear, to visit Carmela I must ask her father’s permission, but he is a hard man, and unreasonable in his ways, never swaying if his mind is settled, no matter the argument. He is a <i class="calibre5">muratore</i>, a mason, respected for his skill with stone and mortar and I have been told he only respects men with a trade, making no secret his daughter would be better dead than married to a dirt farmer, like me, or any farmer, except a landowner.  Sicilian women are tough, raised hard by this cruel life we lead, failing to hunger, disease, and most of all childbirth, but they suffer silently, as it is the woman’s place to obey their men, a quality most admire, even the women, but men admire it more than women. Why do women admire it? Admire it or be beaten, in some cases(I have not seen it in my family, thank God). Patri Carmine says  women must obey their husbands and submit to them. ‘Submit’ is a powerful word. I ask him, are women inferior to men? “Not inferior,” he says, “but not equal, and not able to make decisions on their own.” </p>
<p id="page_181" class="calibre6">*Zio Enrico (my uncle) knows signuri Rao all his life, as they worked in the fields together, but went their own ways, for reasons he cannot remember, and they no longer speak when they pass on the street.  As young men they brought wine to the cemetery, and drank too much and were drunk, and they played cards in the piazza, eyeing every woman who passed, saying pleasant  things to the ones who met their high standard of what a woman should be, ignoring the rest. Rao was called “<i class="calibre5">il gallo</i>,” the rooster, as he laughed, hearty, and would claim all the free women, the “little chickens,” for himself.  Rao is like a cop, because he has good reason to mistrust all men who would ask to court his daughters, who are beautiful, and Carmela is the most beautiful, as I see it.          </p>
<p class="calibre6">Zio warned me, “Rao is a wanderer, like a wolf…he has no home.”  He disappears for days, leaving his wife and daughters to their own, then he reappears out of thin air, like a ghost and refuses to say where he was or what he was doing there. One story we hear, but I believe it to be false, that he is a bandit and flees into the hills when the law is on to him. Foolishness.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He is working the stone somewhere,” his wife says when you ask, but she never looks you in the eye, so it is a dishonest answer. He has other women, it is said, but no man says this to his face. My zio worked the orchards with him, picking fruit and trimming trees and no man worked harder, or faster, than Signuri Rao. “But, when the wandering mood hit him, he had a routine where he went to the bush for a piss and would not come back for two, three days, but he worked like two men, so his job was always there.”  Zio pinched his nose and laughed, warning me again of Rao’s hatred of dirt farmers. “Our brains are soft, like shit,” Rao has said a hundred times, but years ago. Maybe he has changed.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I live in the same Commune with Carmela, and I have seen her many times, but in the piazza, or at Festa, her mother is there, and Giovanna, her sister, and they walk together, arm in arm, and signuri Rao is always somewhere else. If Carmela saw me, maybe a glance would pass between us, never a good and steady look. A smile? <i class="calibre5">Mai</i> (never). I followed her a few times, but from a distance, hoping to get close and she might nod, or I would see her smile and nothing else. I am an honorable man, yet I confess how I enjoy watching her walk, the way she moved her young hips. When I was desperate and lovesick (I am embarrassed to use these words, but true) I hid in a stand of trees, to watch her walk and see her young hips move, while she balanced stones on her head, with the grace of a dancer. Once she passed within a few feet of me, but gave nothing more than a cold stare; no smile, no good look. Her father yelled to her (he could have been drunk), “bring me the stone, god damn it…the mortar is setting up,” and Carmela ran, near tripping on loose cobblestone. I was angry that he raised his voice to her, but it was not my place to complain or defend her, yet, but maybe someday, and that was enough to keep me going. </p>
<p id="page_182" class="calibre6">I could not clear my mind, or forget those hips, how they moved when she walked, but I did not see her for a month from that day, and it was an act of God that brought us together.  The rains were fierce through the months of January and February, turning the hard fields from December drought, into mud a foot thick. I had a few days’ work mending equipment for *<i class="calibre5">Andrea Micelli</i>, who owned orchards, mostly lemon orchards, and in summer and fall I helped tend his five hundred trees, if it promised to be a good market that year. He was a small landowner, but mostly he treated me square, paying less than the bigger bosses, but easier to work for and never raised his voice. He wanted to pay more, that we deserved more, but he was afraid of what the other small landowners would say.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was late in the afternoon, quitting time, the sun hidden by black, angry clouds that covered the top of Etna. I knew I would not make it home before the storm came. I tried, I ran, but the thunder came in bursts and the rain was brutal against my face, like a million needles hitting my skin, and lightning struck an oak tree fifty feet from where I stood, splitting the  trunk in half. At every crack, the hairs on my neck and arms tingled. I took cover behind a field wagon, half hidden by the weeds around it, and I admit that I cowered. Who would not?  Another strike near me and the ground shook and the air vibrated, and my wet hair prickled. I had enough. I see an old shack in the middle of the field, a few hundred feet away and I ran for it, when a fierce and ungodly strike hit a tree in my way, breaking off a limb near removing my head at the shoulders. If the man in the moon saw me, he saw a terrified man tearing across a muddy field, dodging strikes, and making the sign of the cross, begging God to save his worthless ass. Almost to the shack, I slip in the mud and hit the door hard, knocking it half off the rusted hinges. When I pulled on the rusted handle, the door broke away from the bottom hinge and hung in the air, swinging back and forth in the wind. Both of them were standing in the middle of the dirt floor, soaked and shivering, Carmela Rao and her sister, Giovanna, who screamed as she backed against the wall.   </p>
<p id="page_183" class="calibre6">“Please do not hurt us,” Giovanna screamed.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What?” was my answer and a foolish look on my face.  I believe she was crying.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Carmela stood her ground, calm and defiant, but her stare, it went through me. Her sister kept saying, “papa will kill you if you hurt us,” and from the corner of my eye I see Carmela smile. I kicked at the door, breaking it away from the top hinge and it fell to the ground, and I stepped over it, into shack, like some conquering lord. Maybe Garibaldi.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I want out of the storm, that’s all,” I said, my hat in my hand. “No reason to fear me.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then get out,” Giovanna said, pointing over my shoulder. “I will tell my…”    </p>
<p id="page_184" class="calibre6">Carmela moved toward me. “<i class="calibre5">Stai zitto,</i> be quiet,” she said to her sister, who obeyed. “He is Antonino Sparacino from the village... you know him...we see him in the piazza.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">She knows my name, my God. How can this be? We have not been introduced. I know her name and her sisters name, but I have asked others. Then she has asked a friend, maybe a cousin  about me, and I hope it was a friendly person, who said good things.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was dripping on the dirt floor, and my wool hat, that was soaked (I foolishly put it back on my head, so not to feel naked) was dripping rainwater over my forehead, into my eyes.  “Scusa,” I said, ringing my cap to dry it. How silly I must have looked; soaked to the skin, holes in my pants, no haircut since Christmas. “Scusa,” I say again, moving back a step to keep a respectable distance, but one foot caught the other and my feet twisted together, and I near fell to the floor. I must have looked like a fool with the gyrations I needed to save myself.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The rain…”  Carmela raised her hand. “It is a terrible day. You had no choice?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">We made petty talk a while, about the weather; Carmela said how much she hated the rain, like her father. “Rain must be bad for business,” I said, hoping not to seem a foolish man to these two young girls. Carmela nodded.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“That is true. It is bad for papas work, but more, it makes the day dark and depressing.” Giovanna moved next to Carmela, and they tightly held hands. I see they were close, even close for two sisters, who are always closer than two brothers.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The rain had not let up, a driving rain that leaked through rotted joints in the walls and ceiling, settling in the low part of the dirt floor. The mud was ankle high and thick, from good planting soil. I thought on being the hero, of laying my jacket on the floor, but her sister might see some reason I did not intend, as it meant removing my garment. No thank you. One time the fool was enough. Giovanna stood back from the threshold and stared into the night.  </p>
<p id="page_185" class="calibre6">“Papa will be coming for us any time,” she said, and I believed it to be true.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Carmela laughed. “Oh, stop lying,” she says to her sister, who was caught and knew it, and looked away. Carmela smiled wide and her teeth were straight and clean.  </p>
<p class="calibre8">“You act like Antonino is a bandit. He is not.” She turned and spoke to me. “Papa is gone for a week...maybe two, but my sister, who I love more than life, enjoys  </p>
<p class="calibre4">telling stories.” My heart beat hard, like a <i class="calibre5">succiacapre</i> bird. I wish I remember the day, the time, because for me and Carmela, our life came together at that moment.   </p>
<p class="calibre8">“It rained so much this winter,” she said. “There will be nothing left come Spring.”  Her </p>
<p class="calibre4">father’s words, she admitted. Was it true? Did I agree? Giovanna moved between us, and we separated to a respectable distance, but now I was too close to Giovanna, and she backed away a few steps and they argued. It was between the sisters and not my business. By now, it was sweat, not rainwater, dripping down my forehead.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What are you doing here?” I ask. Giovanna took a few more steps back. Carmella, who I saw as the boss, was slow to speak, but saying they were looking for <i class="calibre5">nuove pietre</i>(new stones) from the foot of the mountain, for a church repair, although her father did not want to work for the church (they each made the sign of the cross) as the priests wanted to pay in prayers and indulgences, rather than the agreed price. The bishop was worse, she said. He did not pay at all.    </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Nuove pietre</i>? What is it? Do I ask?  If I ask, will she think I am ignorant man, or if I do not, she will think I have no interest in what she is doing?  Here, in this shack, only in this shack, I believe ignorance to be the better choice.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Scusa. You say ‘<i class="calibre5">nuove pietre.’</i> New stone? What does it mean?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">They took each other’s hand and laughed.  </p>
<p id="page_186" class="calibre6"> “<i class="calibre5">Nuove pietre</i>? You do not know <i class="calibre5">nuove pietre</i>?<i class="calibre5">”</i> I imagined they were thinking, “A dirt farmer. Papa is right.” I turned to the door, ready to leave, escape, even in the cloudburst.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are honest,” she said. “How would you know…you are not a mason, like papa.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I keep nodding, like some fool who enjoyed being a fool.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will tell you,” She said, politely. “No one is interested…I am glad you asked...how do I explain this.” She thought, and I liked her looks even more when she was thinking. This look on her face. “The stones at the bottom of the mountain are old and picked over, not good for building walls or foundations. When Etna rumbles, even slightly, rocks break away from the side of the mountains and fall to the bottom, and these stones are ‘new stone,’ and papa can build with these stones, so he calls them <i class="calibre5">nuove pietre</i>.  It makes sense when you think.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Giovanna worried that with the rain they would not collect enough <i class="calibre5">nuove pietre</i>, and their papa will say the storm was no excuse, that they are lazy. Her real fear, I believe, is that their papa might find out about me, about this time together in the shack. They had reason to fear him, he was a hard drinker, using violence for no good reason. This was his reputation in the <i class="calibre5">comune</i>. “It is not good enough to pick any <i class="calibre5">nuove pietre</i>,” she said, “but the stone must be the right weight and shape and we must stack them right, or it costs papa time…time is money…have you heard this before, Antonino?  Time is money. Papa says it all the time.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Time is money? Have I heard it? No, I cannot say I have heard it said before, but I do not speak from experience, as I have time but no money, and by her father’s reckoning I should be a wealthy man. In truth, I had no interest, or did I give a shit about these <i class="calibre5">nuove pietre, </i>or speeches about time and money. I cared about gazing at her green eyes and smooth, olive skin. If I had the guts to touch her face. Would she hate me for it? Would she? I wondered. She is a woman for a young girl, I mean slim and well kept, the way women should be, and not tiny or sickly, like women with consumption, or in need of a good meal, or have given up on life. I stared at all of her, up close, and I found her mature and appealing, and I was embarrassed. A grown woman, as I see her, but a child, my brother says. These thoughts  embarrassed me, and I turn away from her. “Sinful” thoughts, Patri says. Maybe. Then “sinful” is good.    </p>
<p id="page_187" class="calibre6">Their father, I was told, was a man of irregular spirit, who has threatened to move the family to Messina, where the money is better for a man of his skill, as he blames the town of his birth for holding him back. “Too many dirt farmers,” he says in the piazza (so I have been told). If he goes, Carmela and Giovanna will go, and the mother if he says so, as he will make decisions for these girls until they are married. He is an old and strict <i class="calibre5">Sicilianu</i>, and not abiding of women who refuse to accept their place in the world, as a place of cooking and cleaning and birthing children, and to be happy with it. To accept it is not enough. Does he beat his daughters, or his wife? I have no evidence, or is there rumor, but his wife has been seen in the piazza with marks on her face and arms. When the women ask, “from a fall,” she says and covers up, or claims she was kicked by some animal, but *<i class="calibre5">zia Paola</i>, my mother’s sister, has heard from good people that the ‘animal’ is Signuri Rao, himself.  If this is true, then he is a pitiful man, and I would fight him because of it. Probably I would fight him. I chose not to believe the stories and the rumors, but would they say it was true if I asked. They are good Sicilian women. He has the right, and this is his thinking. If I knew he beat Carmela, or Giovanna, or his wife, what would I do? If Carmela was my wife, I would kill him. My father is a dignified man and has never beat my mother or my sisters. If he did, I would not respect him. Would I fight him? I cannot say, but he is a civilized man, thank God.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">My uncle warns me to fear Rao, but I say, what courage does it take to beat a woman, if he does? His hatred for dirt farmers is well-known, as he has said it many times, that over his dead body would his daughters marry a dirt farmer. Maybe this is how he shows love for his girls, that he would save them from the fate of women who are tied to the land with their men, and their youth is stolen by the harshness of a women’s life, and any joy is rare and short lived and, in the end, painful, as so many die young. Twenty is forty and forty is eighty, and for women there is no escape without a good man, and maybe not even then.   </p>
<p id="page_188" class="calibre6">Can I fault him for this?             </p>
<p class="calibre6">The rain slowed to a drizzle and the wind no more than a mild breeze. It was near dark, and the hill trail might be washed out, deep with greasy mud made from the fine soil, and treacherous.  Giovanna stood at the doorway, pleading with Carmela. “It is time to leave. It is getting dark, and mama will worry.” Carmela came closer to me, enough to touch; we did not touch, but the air between us was warm, when other air was chilly and damp. My hands shook, my heart beat hard and fast, like the bird’s heart and I could barely breathe. I wanted to touch her, but I knew it could start a feud that would last forever. The back of my neck ached. I sweated; my legs wobbled like they were loose in the joints. I had stirred (in that private way), I am ashamed to say, so I turn to the wall, praying Giovanna did not see, and in a while, it was all right and no longer a thing of shame.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is it possible we can meet again?” I ask, ready to drop to my knees. “But not here, like this, but under the supervision of your family? Is this possible?” I coughed. She smiled and took a step back, hands clasped at her waist.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My shoes. They are muddy,” she said. “Ruined.” But she never answered my question.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Giovanna grabbed at Carmela’s sleeve, who pushes her hand away. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you want?” she asked her sister, who was almost in tears. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is time to leave,” she said, and moved back a few steps.         </p>
<p id="page_189" class="calibre6">“May I visit with you sometime?” I ask.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Carmela took a deep breath, “My father…,” she coughed and apologized.  “My father must give his permission. You know that.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If he says yes?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If papa says yes, I say yes.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazie. This is what I wanted to hear.” Giovanna walked to the doorway.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The storm has stopped, Carmela. It’s time to go…mama will tell Papa we were late.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She is right,” I said. “This innocent meeting can make trouble between our families.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I know. Papa will think the worst,” Carmela said. “He will be angry you were here.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But your sister, Giovanna, she is witness. This is accidental…innocent.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Papa will always think the worst. That you meant to…to…”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I turned white. I know it. I had no mirror, but I know it. I turned white. </p>
<p class="calibre6">‘You ruined them,’ he will say and want to fight. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Thank God. If I piss my pants, they will think I am wet from the rain.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Before war breaks out between our families, I will go to Signuri Rao and ask his  permission to visit Carmella. If he demands it, I will eat his shit; if he says ‘no,’ I walk away, and never look back. What else can I do?  I say to Carmela, “It was the storm, the lightening that brought us together. I will tell your father it was an act of God and meant to be.” She waved her hands.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. Please. Never mention God to my father.” She wrung her hands. “Mama is Godfearing, but papa is a heathen. He hates churches and priests, anything religious.”  </p>
<p id="page_190" class="calibre6">Will he think I am like the old women who pack the churches on Sunday. If I had money, or land, how we met would be of no matter, as everyone enjoys the warm feeling of silver, and the melody coins make jingling in the pocket. Papa says it is everyman’s song.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Carmela and Giovanna walked to the doorway, and it was plain to me they were nervous, but Giovanna was the more nervous, and I liked that Carmela was strong, and her own person.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are leaving, Antonino,” she said, smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked at her and her Sicilian eyes that were green and deep, and bright, like I imagine emeralds shining in the light.  If she was <i class="calibre5">brutè</i>, ugly, and she is not, or <i class="calibre5">grasso</i>, fat, and she is not, her eyes would still be enough for me, or would I bother with her? I wonder, was I a strong man, like Carmela was a strong woman? I was excited, so I exaggerate, but I needed more than her beautiful eyes, but maybe I will tell that story another time. Giovanna took her sisters arm and pulled her through the doorway, into the evening and the wind was picking up, so it was colder than a while ago.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">I worried they would freeze, as they had no shawls, and their dresses were soaked and would drag the muddy earth. Carmela needs a good man, like me, to watch her and protect her. We faced each other and came the awkward moment when men and women say goodbye.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Soon I will ask your father permission to call on you. Be sure your sister not to mention today…tell her.”  Carmela looked at Giovanna and laughed, “She will say what I ask her to say.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You will see me again?” I asked her for a second time.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Giovanna yelled from the shadows near the path, “Let’s go. I am freezing.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I told you, Antonino… a minute ago. Nothing has changed my mind. “She turned her head slightly and I saw the gentle slope of her nose, like a Grecian nose.   </p>
<p id="page_191" class="calibre6">“If papa gives his permission, I will see you again. As often as you like.” I had my answer. It was the best day of my wife, and who would think the best day would be a cold and shitty day, not fit for dogs?  Carmela whispers to Giovanna, she perked up and stepped back, acting surprised, and they both look at me and laughed.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">I ask Carmela, “What did you say?” She smiled.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not for you to know,” she said, and they laughed again. Carmela said goodbye, and hoped we would see each other soon, and she would say a Novena at Sant’Agatha every day until it happened. The sisters started down the narrow, muddy path; slow at first, and they talked and looked back at me and laughed, and both broke into a run.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Arrivederci,” I said quietly to myself. They waved and they were gone into the shadows.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Women are a mystery to me, but some men look in disbelief when I say it, as if they have the answer and know what all the other men do not know. “You were a soldier,” they might say, and where there is an army, there are women. No? Yes, it is true. Many women. But women for sale, a few lire and cheap wine. Indecent women, all of them, some diseased and sickly, yet they offered themselves for sale, and foolish men bought them, and some were sick from it; one died that I recall(a foolish Captain we hated). *<i class="calibre5">Giovanni </i>something, from Apulia. Soldiers like whores, and the soldiers from the cities, Roma, Milano, were animals when these harlots showed up to ask for money and offer services. Patri Carmine warned me. “They are evil, and they live on the edge of the ‘abyss that is hell.’” Patri was good with words. At my first camp, the very day I arrive, three or four soldiers, who were drunk, surrounded me and demanded to know if I ever knew a woman? </p>
<p class="calibre6">I laughed, saying boldly. with confidence, “What do you think,” but they laughed? </p>
<p class="calibre6">When I am near a decent woman, who demands respect, like Carmela, all I can say is that I sweat on the back of my neck, like a pig in the sun, and I babble like ten fools chained together. Under my breath I pray, asking only that she will not laugh at me, or run from me, like I was a leper. Do not get the wrong idea; I have not visited whores, or other loose women who would not ask for money, but a little grappa and I was not cheated by these women, like other soldiers, but the army cheated me and took two years of my life, giving me nothing in return. They were valuable years; the young years I could have built a family, or work, but no. What did they give me in return? Nothing, but the chance to be near “<i class="calibre5">puttanu</i> ,” whores, at a reasonable price; this is what the men in the goods suits say will make me a man. Nothing I saw, the puttanu’s, or anything I heard, the talk that all women are whores, changed my mind. Women are good people, even some whores are good people. loving in a way. I believe this to be true, but the men who pile shit high tell the wrong story and never tell the truth. Women are better than men, anytime.      </p>
<p id="page_192" class="calibre6">I come from a small and ancient town, isolated from the world, and we all live and work in the shadow of the great mountain, that does nothing for us but grow a few chestnuts, and once in a while it sends fire and ash, that is a beautiful sight at night, except for the damage it does. Many in the village are related by blood, and the priest will refuse to marry two good people because they are cousins and men grow desperate for a woman and walk to other villages to find a decent woman, not of the same blood and suitable for marriage.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“To get a decent woman,” the way some men mean it, is a vulgarity, and disrespectful, but honest, as it speaks to the thinking in their mind. To marry a woman you do not know, is like buying a mule from a stranger, though this is a bad example. About her reputation. Who will testify to her character?  Is she diseased, or worse, lazy? </p>
<p id="page_193" class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Vincenzo Dallucci</i>, a cousin from my mother’s side, walked miles to <i class="calibre5">Roccolumera</i>, to find a young woman, <i class="calibre5">Agatha Rinaldi</i>, he courted when her family lived in our village, before her father took the family to the coast for a better life. Bad for him, because he was interested. Vincenzo did not follow her, and failed to offer marriage before they left, and did not think about her again until felt the need to marry. Some years later, *Giuseppe Aldi, a low life <i class="calibre5">capu,</i> a friend of the girl’s father, tells cugino Vincenzo he recently saw the girl and her family in Roccolumera at a gathering in the piazza. “She is strong and hardworking; more beautiful than ever. She asked  about you, how you were doing in life. That’s what she said, I swear it.” When <i class="calibre5">Dallucci’s</i> back was turned, his old boss winked to the men around, and they all knew it was a joke, except mio cugino.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is she married, yet?” my cousin asked. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not married. But looking. And remember, she asked after you.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">So desperate was Vincenzo for a good woman(a good wife)he decided to walk the way to Roccolumera in the winter, hoping she would still be to his liking( he prayed she was still thin and had all her teeth, at least the ones that showed), and her father would agree that he could court her and marry her in the spring. He would convince her father of his worth as a son-in-law.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am hardworking. I believe in God. I never curse at women, or will I ever beat your daughter or take her far away from your home, but back to Ali, where she was born.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Vincenzo reached the farm by walking two days and two nights in a cold rain, where along the way he was sized up by two criminal looking men  who were certainly <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>, but they did not bother attacking him as he probably seemed to be a pauper and broke. Sadly, though, when he arrived to <i class="calibre5">Roccolumera</i>, her father had only his sympathy for my cousin.  </p>
<p id="page_194" class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiace</i>,” he said, a sad look on his face, “but I say this with regret, my beautiful daughter was married only a month ago, to an older man, but he is well-to-do with land, and how much longer can he live? You are too late. <i class="calibre5">È un peccato</i> (its a shame). I like your looks better. If only you came a month ago…and had land.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">My cousin, Vincenzo was a broken man, and blamed *<i class="calibre5">Giuseppe Aldi</i>, on whose word he made the trip, and her father laughed, saying he knew <i class="calibre5">Aldi</i> well, for thirty years; he even attended the wedding as a guest. “I know and respect <i class="calibre5">Giuseppe Aldi</i>, but he is a joker, and he has made a fool of you. Too bad. I remember your family…good people.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Vincenzo was a hothead. Right off he swore revenge for this slight to his honor, as the whole village will think him a fool. He respectfully thanked her father and started for home, but in less than two miles, and for no other reason than to pour salt in his wound, he was robbed by the two men who had sized him up on the way down and they left him beaten and broke along the roadside. When he finally made it home (after two days with a doctor near <i class="calibre5">Nizza di Sicilia</i>) he hunted down his old boss, who offered no apology, saying this, only a perdente (loser) would walk two days and two nights, in the cold rain, and take a beating and be robbed, just for the chance to “fuck a peasant woman.” They fought, of course. Vincenzo was the poorer man but the better fighter and beat his old boss silly. Giuseppe Aldi was a proud man and landowner, who could not afford to overlook a beating at the hands of a peasant, and he called in the Carabinieri, who vowed to arrest my cousin and demand prison. Cousin Vincenzo fled to the mountains, returning nights to see his family and pickup up food and dry clothes. His father, my uncle, was proud for the beating his son gave the <i class="calibre5">capu</i>, but he was a practical man and understood what had to be done. He goes to the capu, hat in hand, and begs for his son, and the priest goes with him to preach forgiveness. After a time, it was all forgotten, and Vincenzo returned home, but he could not find work for a long time, until the capu died.    </p>
<p id="page_195" class="calibre6">When I tell this story they ask me, what does this have to do with Carmela?  I tell it to show I have only good feelings for women, and I respect them and I do not believe they live to make my life better, but that we live to make each other’s life better. Some laugh, others scoff and say what I believe is not what God believes, or what his Church believes, or the way things should be. Best is for the man to be the boss and women to be obedient, and maybe this is what I believe to this day.    </p>
