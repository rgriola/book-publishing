<h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px; font-style: italic;">The Mason's Daughter</h1>

<p>I recall the day I met <em>Carmela</em>, face to face, though she had long been on my mind. I saw her many times walking the high path near the mountain, and this one day I thought she smiled as we passed and I stumbled, hitting my head against the <em>Etruscan</em> wall, and the workers laughed, making me feel the fool. I saw her many times on this road, although we never spoke, but I recall nodding politely, two, maybe three times. More a nod you give to a neighbor as you pass on the street. <em>Luca</em> said I am like a glove on her slender hand, and she has turned me inside out, even though not a word passed between us, and I cannot say if she laughed the day I fell. My brother <em>Paolo</em> says I am a fool of a man, that she is a child and too young for me, even in <em>Sicilia</em>. Six, seven years, is that a great difference? He wants her for himself. This I believed to be true.</p>

<p><em>Carmela</em> is the oldest daughter of <em>Paolo Rao</em>, the other is <em>Giovanna</em>, younger and not as beautiful. The Sicilian tradition is clear, to visit <em>Carmela</em> I must ask her father’s permission, but he is a hard man, and unreasonable in his ways, never swaying if his mind is settled, no matter the argument. He is a <em>muratore</em>, a mason, respected for his skill with stone and mortar and I have been told he only respects men with a trade, making no secret his daughter would be better dead than married to a dirt farmer, like me, or any farmer, except a landowner. Sicilian women are tough, raised hard by this cruel life we lead, failing to hunger, disease, and most of all childbirth, but they suffer silently, as it is the woman’s place to obey their men, a quality most admire, even the women, but men admire it more than women. Why do women admire it? Admire it or be beaten, in some cases(I have not seen it in my family, thank God). <em>Patri Carmine</em> says women must obey their husbands and submit to them. ‘Submit’ is a powerful word. I ask him, are women inferior to men? “Not inferior,” he says, “but not equal, and not able to make decisions on their own.”</p>

<h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Rooster and the Wolf</h3>

<p><em>Zio Enrico</em> (my uncle) knows <em>signuri Rao</em> all his life, as they worked in the fields together, but went their own ways, for reasons he cannot remember, and they no longer speak when they pass on the street. As young men they brought wine to the cemetery, and drank too much and were drunk, and they played cards in the <em>piazza</em>, eyeing every woman who passed, saying pleasant things to the ones who met their high standard of what a woman should be, ignoring the rest. <em>Rao</em> was called “<em>il gallo</em>,” the rooster, as he laughed, hearty, and would claim all the free women, the “little chickens,” for himself. <em>Rao</em> is like a cop, because he has good reason to mistrust all men who would ask to court his daughters, who are beautiful, and <em>Carmela</em> is the most beautiful, as I see it.</p>

<p><em>Zio</em> warned me, “<em>Rao</em> is a wanderer, like a wolf…he has no home.” He disappears for days, leaving his wife and daughters to their own, then he reappears out of thin air, like a ghost and refuses to say where he was or what he was doing there. One story we hear, but I believe it to be false, that he is a bandit and flees into the hills when the law is on to him. Foolishness.</p>

<p>“He is working the stone somewhere,” his wife says when you ask, but she never looks you in the eye, so it is a dishonest answer. He has other women, it is said, but no man says this to his face. My <em>zio</em> worked the orchards with him, picking fruit and trimming trees and no man worked harder, or faster, than <em>Signuri Rao</em>. “But, when the wandering mood hit him, he had a routine where he went to the bush for a piss and would not come back for two, three days, but he worked like two men, so his job was always there.” <em>Zio</em> pinched his nose and laughed, warning me again of <em>Rao’s</em> hatred of dirt farmers. “Our brains are soft, like shit,” <em>Rao</em> has said a hundred times, but years ago. Maybe he has changed.”</p>

<p>I live in the same <em>comune</em> with <em>Carmela</em>, and I have seen her many times, but in the <em>piazza</em>, or at <em>Festa</em>, her mother is there, and <em>Giovanna</em>, her sister, and they walk together, arm in arm, and <em>signuri Rao</em> is always somewhere else. If <em>Carmela</em> saw me, maybe a glance would pass between us, never a good and steady look. A smile? <em>Mai</em> (never). I followed her a few times, but from a distance, hoping to get close and she might nod, or I would see her smile and nothing else. I am an honorable man, yet I confess how I enjoy watching her walk, the way she moved her young hips. When I was desperate and lovesick (I am embarrassed to use these words, but true) I hid in a stand of trees, to watch her walk and see her young hips move, while she balanced stones on her head, with the grace of a dancer. Once she passed within a few feet of me, but gave nothing more than a cold stare; no smile, no good look. Her father yelled to her (he could have been drunk), “bring me the stone, god damn it…the mortar is setting up,” and <em>Carmela</em> ran, near tripping on loose cobblestone. I was angry that he raised his voice to her, but it was not my place to complain or defend her, yet, but maybe someday, and that was enough to keep me going.</p>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">Shelter From the Sky</h3>

<p>I could not clear my mind, or forget those hips, how they moved when she walked, but I did not see her for a month from that day, and it was an act of God that brought us together. The rains were fierce through the months of January and February, turning the hard fields from December drought, into mud a foot thick. I had a few days’ work mending equipment for <em>Andrea Micelli</em>, who owned orchards, mostly lemon orchards, and in summer and fall I helped tend his five hundred trees, if it promised to be a good market that year. He was a small landowner, but mostly he treated me square, paying less than the bigger bosses, but easier to work for and never raised his voice. He wanted to pay more, that we deserved more, but he was afraid of what the other small landowners would say.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, quitting time, the sun hidden by black, angry clouds that covered the top of <em>Etna</em>. I knew I would not make it home before the storm came. I tried, I ran, but the thunder came in bursts and the rain was brutal against my face, like a million needles hitting my skin, and lightning struck an oak tree fifty feet from where I stood, splitting the trunk in half. At every crack, the hairs on my neck and arms tingled. I took cover behind a field wagon, half hidden by the weeds around it, and I admit that I cowered. Who would not? Another strike near me and the ground shook and the air vibrated, and my wet hair prickled. I had enough. I see an old shack in the middle of the field, a few hundred feet away and I ran for it, when a fierce and ungodly strike hit a tree in my way, breaking off a limb near removing my head at the shoulders. If the man in the moon saw me, he saw a terrified man tearing across a muddy field, dodging strikes, and making the sign of the cross, begging God to save his worthless ass. Almost to the shack, I slip in the mud and hit the door hard, knocking it half off the rusted hinges. When I pulled on the rusted handle, the door broke away from the bottom hinge and hung in the air, swinging back and forth in the wind. Both of them were standing in the middle of the dirt floor, soaked and shivering, <em>Carmela Rao</em> and her sister, <em>Giovanna</em>, who screamed as she backed against the wall.</p>

<p>“Please do not hurt us,” <em>Giovanna</em> screamed.</p>

<p>“What?” was my answer and a foolish look on my face. I believe she was crying.</p>

<p><em>Carmela</em> stood her ground, calm and defiant, but her stare, it went through me. Her sister kept saying, “papa will kill you if you hurt us,” and from the corner of my eye I see <em>Carmela</em> smile. I kicked at the door, breaking it away from the top hinge and it fell to the ground, and I stepped over it, into shack, like some conquering lord. Maybe <em>Garibaldi</em>.</p>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">Nuove Pietre</h3>

<p>“I want out of the storm, that’s all,” I said, my hat in my hand. “No reason to fear me.” “Then get out,” <em>Giovanna</em> said, pointing over my shoulder. “I will tell my…”</p>

<p><em>Carmela</em> moved toward me. “<em>Stai zitto</em>, be quiet,” she said to her sister, who obeyed. “He is <em>Antonino Sparacino</em> from the village... you know him...we see him in the <em>piazza</em>.”</p>

<p>She knows my name, my God. How can this be? We have not been introduced. I know her name and her sisters name, but I have asked others. Then she has asked a friend, maybe a cousin about me, and I hope it was a friendly person, who said good things.</p>

<p>I was dripping on the dirt floor, and my wool hat, that was soaked (I foolishly put it back on my head, so not to feel naked) was dripping rainwater over my forehead, into my eyes. “<em>Scusa</em>,” I said, ringing my cap to dry it. How silly I must have looked; soaked to the skin, holes in my pants, no haircut since Christmas. “<em>Scusa</em>,” I say again, moving back a step to keep a respectable distance, but one foot caught the other and my feet twisted together, and I near fell to the floor. I must have looked like a fool with the gyrations I needed to save myself.</p>

<p>“The rain…” <em>Carmela</em> raised her hand. “It is a terrible day. You had no choice?”</p>

<p>We made petty talk a while, about the weather; <em>Carmela</em> said how much she hated the rain, like her father. “Rain must be bad for business,” I said, hoping not to seem a foolish man to these two young girls. <em>Carmela</em> nodded. “That is true. It is bad for papas work, but more, it makes the day dark and depressing.” <em>Giovanna</em> moved next to <em>Carmela</em>, and they tightly held hands. I see they were close, even close for two sisters, who are always closer than two brothers.</p>

<p>The rain had not let up, a driving rain that leaked through rotted joints in the walls and ceiling, settling in the low part of the dirt floor. The mud was ankle high and thick, from good planting soil. I thought on being the hero, of laying my jacket on the floor, but her sister might see some reason I did not intend, as it meant removing my garment. No thank you. One time the fool was enough. <em>Giovanna</em> stood back from the threshold and stared into the night. “Papa will be coming for us any time,” she said, and I believed it to be true. <em>Carmela</em> laughed. “Oh, stop lying,” she says to her sister, who was caught and knew it, and looked away. <em>Carmela</em> smiled wide and her teeth were straight and clean. “You act like <em>Antonino</em> is a bandit. He is not.” She turned and spoke to me. “Papa is gone for a week...maybe two, but my sister, who I love more than life, enjoys telling stories.” My heart beat hard, like a <em>succiacapre</em> bird. I wish I remember the day, the time, because for me and <em>Carmela</em>, our life came together at that moment.</p>

<p>“It rained so much this winter,” she said. “There will be nothing left come Spring.” Her father’s words, she admitted. Was it true? Did I agree? <em>Giovanna</em> moved between us, and we separated to a respectable distance, but now I was too close to <em>Giovanna</em>, and she backed away a few steps and they argued. It was between the sisters and not my business. By now, it was sweat, not rainwater, dripping down my forehead.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” I ask. <em>Giovanna</em> took a few more steps back. <em>Carmella</em>, who I saw as the boss, was slow to speak, but saying they were looking for <em>nuove pietre</em> (new stones) from the foot of the mountain, for a church repair, although her father did not want to work for the church (they each made the sign of the cross) as the priests wanted to pay in prayers and indulgences, rather than the agreed price. The bishop was worse, she said. He did not pay at all.</p>

<p><em>Nuove pietre</em>? What is it? Do I ask? If I ask, will she think I am ignorant man, or if I do not, she will think I have no interest in what she is doing? Here, in this shack, only in this shack, I believe ignorance to be the better choice.</p>

<p>“<em>Scusa</em>. You say ‘<em>nuove pietre</em>.’ New stone? What does it mean?” They took each other’s hand and laughed. “<em>Nuove pietre</em>? You do not know <em>nuove pietre</em>?” I imagined they were thinking, “A dirt farmer. Papa is right.” I turned to the door, ready to leave, escape, even in the cloudburst.</p>

<p>“You are honest,” she said. “How would you know…you are not a mason, like papa.” I keep nodding, like some fool who enjoyed being a fool. “I will tell you,” She said, politely. “No one is interested…I am glad you asked...how do I explain this.” She thought, and I liked her looks even more when she was thinking. This look on her face. “The stones at the bottom of the mountain are old and picked over, not good for building walls or foundations. When <em>Etna</em> rumbles, even slightly, rocks break away from the side of the mountains and fall to the bottom, and these stones are ‘new stone,’ and papa can build with these stones, so he calls them <em>nuove pietre</em>. It makes sense when you think.”</p>

<p><em>Giovanna</em> worried that with the rain they would not collect enough <em>nuove pietre</em>, and their papa will say the storm was no excuse, that they are lazy. Her real fear, I believe, is that their papa might find out about me, about this time together in the shack. They had reason to fear him, he was a hard drinker, using violence for no good reason. This was his reputation in the <em>comune</em>. “It is not good enough to pick any <em>nuove pietre</em>,” she said, “but the stone must be the right weight and shape and we must stack them right, or it costs papa time…time is money…have you heard this before, <em>Antonino</em>? Time is money. Papa says it all the time.”</p>

<p>Time is money? Have I heard it? No, I cannot say I have heard it said before, but I do not speak from experience, as I have time but no money, and by her father’s reckoning I should be a wealthy man. In truth, I had no interest, or did I give a shit about these <em>nuove pietre</em>, or speeches about time and money. I cared about gazing at her green eyes and smooth, olive skin. If I had the guts to touch her face. Would she hate me for it? Would she? I wondered. She is a woman for a young girl, I mean slim and well kept, the way women should be, and not tiny or sickly, like women with consumption, or in need of a good meal, or have given up on life. I stared at all of her, up close, and I found her mature and appealing, and I was embarrassed. A grown woman, as I see her, but a child, my brother says. These thoughts embarrassed me, and I turn away from her. “Sinful” thoughts, <em>Patri</em> says. Maybe. Then “sinful” is good.</p>

<p>Their father, I was told, was a man of irregular spirit, who has threatened to move the family to Messina, where the money is better for a man of his skill, as he blames the town of his birth for holding him back. “Too many dirt farmers,” he says in the <em>piazza</em> (so I have been told). If he goes, <em>Carmela</em> and <em>Giovanna</em> will go, and the mother if he says so, as he will make decisions for these girls until they are married. He is an old and strict <em>Sicilianu</em>, and not abiding of women who refuse to accept their place in the world, as a place of cooking and cleaning and birthing children, and to be happy with it. To accept it is not enough. Does he beat his daughters, or his wife? I have no evidence, or is there rumor, but his wife has been seen in the <em>piazza</em> with marks on her face and arms. When the women ask, “from a fall,” she says and covers up, or claims she was kicked by some animal, but <em>zia Paola</em>, my mother’s sister, has heard from good people that the ‘animal’ is <em>Signuri Rao</em>, himself. If this is true, then he is a pitiful man, and I would fight him because of it. Probably I would fight him. I chose not to believe the stories and the rumors, but would they say it was true if I asked. They are good Sicilian women. He has the right, and this is his thinking. If I knew he beat <em>Carmela</em>, or <em>Giovanna</em>, or his wife, what would I do? If <em>Carmela</em> was my wife, I would kill him. My father is a dignified man and has never beat my mother or my sisters. If he did, I would not respect him. Would I fight him? I cannot say, but he is a civilized man, thank God.</p>

<p>My uncle warns me to fear <em>Rao</em>, but I say, what courage does it take to beat a woman, if he does? His hatred for dirt farmers is well-known, as he has said it many times, that over his dead body would his daughters marry a dirt farmer. Maybe this is how he shows love for his girls, that he would save them from the fate of women who are tied to the land with their men, and their youth is stolen by the harshness of a women’s life, and any joy is rare and short lived and, in the end, painful, as so many die young. Twenty is forty and forty is eighty, and for women there is no escape without a good man, and maybe not even then.</p>

<p>Can I fault him for this?</p>

<p>The rain slowed to a drizzle and the wind no more than a mild breeze. It was near dark, and the hill trail might be washed out, deep with greasy mud made from the fine soil, and treacherous. <em>Giovanna</em> stood at the doorway, pleading with <em>Carmela</em>. “It is time to leave. It is getting dark, and mama will worry.” <em>Carmela</em> came closer to me, enough to touch; we did not touch, but the air between us was warm, when other air was chilly and damp. My hands shook, my heart beat hard and fast, like the bird’s heart and I could barely breathe. I wanted to touch her, but I knew it could start a feud that would last forever. The back of my neck ached. I sweated; my legs wobbled like they were loose in the joints. I had stirred (in that private way), I am ashamed to say, so I turn to the wall, praying <em>Giovanna</em> did not see, and in a while, it was all right and no longer a thing of shame.</p>

<p>“Is it possible we can meet again?” I ask, ready to drop to my knees. “But not here, like this, but under the supervision of your family? Is this possible?” I coughed. She smiled and took a step back, hands clasped at her waist. “My shoes. They are muddy,” she said...</p>
