<h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px; font-style: italic;">The Final Ascent</h1>

<div class="chapter-body">

    <p>*Giacomo* lay in the clean, white bed, the finality of the room pressing down on him. The television was off, the constant flicker of the American world finally silenced. Only the sound of *Signora Elena’s* steady breathing from the chair beside him filled the room. This was the *riposo* (rest) he had earned, though it felt more like a surrender than a victory.</p>

    <p>He remembered the words of *Patri Carmine*: "A life lived in Christ is a continuous journey, but the final ascent is always alone." He was not alone, not truly, but the loneliness of the *viaggio* (journey) was a familiar friend. He thought of *Carmela*, her green eyes, the stubborn set of her jaw when she argued about the farm. He had kept his promise: he had survived. He had bought his ticket to the final passage.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Accounting of Memory</h3>

    <p>His mind became a flickering *lanternino* (small lantern), illuminating brief, intense moments: the shock of the cold Atlantic water on the ship deck; the metallic tang of the factory air; the warmth of a single, small *lira* earned honestly. The life he had built was a mosaic of a thousand tiny, brutal choices, each one demanding a piece of his old self.</p>

    <p>He saw *Luca*, fierce and unyielding, laughing at the idea of sin; he saw *Santo*, making the sign of the cross over a beggar’s empty cup. His companions had defined him, just as the hunger had defined his youth. They had all left something behind to gain this alien, exhausting peace.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Weight of the Stone</h3>

    <p>His hand sought the smooth, heavy river stone *Marcello* had returned to him. It was a tangible piece of the old country, a reminder that the land was permanent, even if the men were not. He felt the weight of the *sacrificio* (sacrifice) his family had made for the promise of *America*—a promise fulfilled, if imperfectly. He had not returned to the farm, but his blood was now rooted here, deep enough to withstand any wind.</p>

    <p>He felt *Signora Elena’s* hand find his, strong and rough from a lifetime of labor, both in the sun-baked fields of *Sicilia* and the humid kitchens of the New World. He whispered a single word, a name only she would understand, a small village on the shoulder of the volcano.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Final Arrivederci</h3>

    <p>“*Arrivederci*,” he thought, releasing the breath he felt he had held for seventy years. Not a goodbye, but 'until we see each other again.' He had crossed the ocean, climbed the new mountain of industry, and finally arrived at the last place. The fear was gone, replaced by the profound quiet of a man who had paid all his debts.</p>

    <p>The dawn was breaking, casting the room in soft hues of grey and gold. The long journey, the *viaggio*, was finally over. He was simply *Giacomo*, resting, preparing for the true, final ascent.</p>
