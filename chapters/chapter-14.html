<!-- Napoli, Fear, and A Beautiful Woman
The train reaches Napoli, where Antonino's fear is heightened, and Luca lusts after a married woman named Amaria.
-->
<div class="chapter-body">


<p class="calibre4">The feel of the wheels rolling on the track, soothed me, like good music, or my grandfather’s wine, if this makes sense. We went on for a time that seemed like all eternity, but with no warning, the train stopped hard, and the cars took up the slack, throwing a man, who was standing for some reason, against the wall and he fell to the floor. Two men helped him up, and he thanked them, then cursed there should have been some warning, but otherwise he was alright. We were in Napoli. I was thankful, but like always, I feared whatever was to come next. This fear is my nature; there is nothing I can do to lose it.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">A young woman, a mother, shook her children, as the jolt did not wake them, and others in the car slept through it, and this I could not understand. She had a son and daughter, but no man, and I guess there might have been a man waiting at the end, as a woman with children cannot be without a man. “You must get up,” she said, gently rubbing the girl’s neck. Her children complained, they were cold and hungry, still tired and scared, but there was a softness in the mother’s voice and the boy was soon on his feet, stretching and yawning, at the same time.  “Look out the door and you see Napoli,” she said, but what did Napoli mean to them, and they ignored her, respectfully. The young girl pleaded, could she sleep longer, and her mother answered quickly, “get ready for the boat,’ and the girl obeyed, gathering what little she had.               </p>
<p class="calibre6">I punched at Santo’s arm to wake him. “Napoli,” I said, “we are in Napoli,” and he sat up and stretched, and like the children, he complained on being cold and hungry.  Amaria pestered her family, and they began to move. In all, the men picked up the luggage and the women gathered the children, and we were ready to leave, except Luca still on the floor, staring at the ceiling of the box car.   </p>
<p id="page_443" class="calibre6">“Where are we?” he asked, though he knew the answer, as “Napoli” had been said a hundred times in the last few minutes.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I laughed. “Where are we? In Napoli, at the station. Are you dead?”       </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Si, Napoli, I forget.”  He could barely speak through the yawning, and the stretching  once he stood. “I need to piss,” he said, looking for a respectable spot inside the car.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not in front of woman,” I said, and he looked at me as if I spoke in some foreign language, but he held it in, thank God.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo brushed the straw from his pants and patted Luca on the shoulder/  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You forgot we were going to Napoli?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. for a minute. A sure sign of old age.” There was a hard rap and another, against the side of the car; the conductor with a four foot club, that Luca claimed was used to beat *<i class="calibre5">vagabondi</i> who jumped the train.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Napoli…the end of the line,” the conductor said, hitting the wall again. “Everyone out.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The floor of the box cars are always high off the track, maybe four or five feet, and this ladder wobbled, and I thought of the gangplank on the ferry, and I prayed. We gathered at the track side and counted heads, then every man, including the male children, went for the thick stand of trees, while the women, watched and wondered. What did women do in these times; I know, now, they do nothing, it seems, unless they wanted to be thought of as a man and not a gentle woman. On long trips, women have been known to soil themselves, rather than use the woods, but I have no personal knowledge of this.  As Luca came out of the trees, he caught sight of Amaria walking the tracks with her daughter. He smiled, and followed her with his eye, like an eagle follows its prey; what feelings come over some men when they see a beautiful woman, I cannot describe. The morning is the worst for these strange feelings, not at night, as you would think.      </p>
<p id="page_444" class="calibre6">Luca whispers in my ear: “my God she is beautiful,” then asked, did I agree?  I did agree, but she is a married woman and hell is a hot and terrible place, and forever. He nodded that he understood, but he could not let it be, no matter the fire of hell. He would gladly give a year of his life to watch her undress; no touching, no funny business, just watching.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“One year,” he repeated. “And gladly.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">*Pietro is my father’s brother, a man of wisdom, I believe, though some say he is a fool. His opinion, and he gives it often, is that men lust mostly after women who are mothers because mothers are broken in, proving themselves healthy and strong and willing.  A year in hell was a high price for watching any woman undress, even Amaria, as beautiful as she is, and twice broken in.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The engine still idling, still spitting black smoke, thick and powerful and it covered where we stood, like a blanket. What it did to lungs I could not imagine. I hear this woman complaining on the black smoke, that it made her son sick, and I see the boy bend over and cough hard, from deep in his lungs, and his mother pats his back, telling him to “spit the shit onto the ground.” She complained, in a loud voice, her son could not breathe, and she wanted a good and caring doctor. She was attractive, not like Amaria(but ‘broken in’), and I questioned zio Pietro’s thinking, that might have been wrong. Her son? Would they let him in, or send him away, as they say America is no place for the sick immigrant, and children are shown no special treatment.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Lights. Bright lights, flickering lights; so many lights, so intense, my eyes ached and watered. This city was grander than I remember,  though the army mostly kept me hidden in Caserta, miles away, and when I came, I came in a horse cart with other soldiers, and they drank and went after women and I walked the streets, watching people watching me.  </p>
<p id="page_445" class="calibre6">It was near ten o’clock at night, people all over the street, as if they grew from the cracks between the cobblestones, like weeds. I said this about Messina, and I believe it is true of any great city. I see a gang of idle sailors standing under a lamp, sharing a bottle of wine, but they passed it around so heartily, most spilt on the ground, and this seemed funny to them, as they watched it and laughed. A group of six, three men, three women, strolled slowly past the sailors, talking quietly among themselves, but they had no luggage, and I guessed they were locals, maybe well to do, enjoying a simple walk along the sea. Three ordinary looking men, and one beautiful woman, who was outfitted in light, soothing blue, and two other women, who were decent looking, but not well dressed. The sailors, as sailors will do, made crude remarks to the women; dirty remarks, and their men objected, offering to fight the sailors, who laughed, but accepted such a foolish challenge. Each side threatened, but in the end the battle was not a battle, only loud talk, and not a punch was thrown, and all moved on. I admit, and for this I am ashamed, I would have enjoyed seeing a good fight.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo pulled his jacket tight around his neck.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Fa freddo</i>… good God its cold,” he said, as he shivered. “Why did I leave Ali?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He cast his eyes cast to the ground. <i class="calibre5">Mio Dio</i>. He is lost, somewhere, I thought, and I am the fool for throwing in with him. He undid his jacket, opening the collar wide and he made no sense when he to Santo “how good the chilly air felt.”  Giovanni, the D’Arrico’s son, tripped on a loose stone, landing hard on the ground, but he was man and refused to cry. His ankle swelled, some, and I know there was pain and we helped the boy to his feet. Emil waived us on.   </p>
<p id="page_446" class="calibre6">“Go ahead. We will catch up.” He carried the boy to a bench along the path, and we moved on, but I promised to hold a spot for his family. He nodded and smiled.  “Grazie.  I knew I could count on you men.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I see a soldier, a tall and impressive man, with the right bearing, standing on a bench in the middle of the square, facing North, and his harsh voice pierced the flesh like a sharp knife. He carried no weapon, </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you have no papers, go home,” he said, in a tone that made his meaning clear. He turned South and said it, then West and East, and back North again.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I proudly patted at my pocket. “We have papers,” I said twice, as the first time he ignored me. He said I should not bother him when he is making announcements, pointing to a building at the end of the wharf.  “The immigration people. See them. They will clear you to leave Italia.”  I looked where he pointed. Shit. What I saw was a line of people stretching across the wharf, the line barely moving, and I feared the boat would leave without us. They had our money, so why would these bastards wait on three peasants from the hills?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo pulled at my coat sleeve, not once, twice. “I am freezing,” he said.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am sorry for your inconvenience.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is so damned cold…I should have stayed home.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Like a dream, everything moved slow at first, then fast; loud then quiet, and people lost their faces, but I knew them; they were me, beaten down, praying for mercy, waiting on the next blow to fall. What day is it? Today is Tuesday, or maybe Wednesday, or is it Thursday? Santo said Thursday. Certainly, it is Thursday, he said, as he counted days on his fingers. His thumb was the day we left; each finger was another day. We were on the road four days or three if the first day did not count. Today is?  Who knew? No one knew.    </p>
<p id="page_447" class="calibre6">We fell in at the end of the line, and I see Emil and his family (the boy was limping) and they were herded to the other line by a guard who demanded the lines be even; he would not tolerate uneven lines, or crooked lines. But it was all right, in any case, as the moon was bright and we could see each other and talk, if we had something to say.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What is today?” I shouted to Emil. He shrugged. Did it make a difference?      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I believe it is Thursday,” he said. “We left home Tuesday. A day to Messina, and a day to Napoli.  Yes, today is Thursday.” Luca said no, certain it was Friday. As we argued, the guards slipped twenty men in front of us, and now we were twenty men farther from the front of the line.  These people, mostly men, but some women, were well dressed, more like gentlemen and gentlewomen; gentlemen and gentlewomen are the wealthy, and I wondered why they were going America.  A <i class="calibre5">contadini,</i> a peasant like me, who was set back in line, made a fuss, complaining men and women were placed in front of us, and a soldier faced him off, naming him a troublemaker, and culled him from the line with the barrel of his rifle. The two men who traveled with him stood mute, and they were left alone. This poor bastard protested, that his treatment was wrong and unfair, and I see the soldier was put out at being challenged, demanding of the man respect, saying he should be grateful he was not going to prison. He was warned, “one last time,” to be silent, and the man obeyed. The soldier went toward the back of the line, looking squarely at me, and I began to shake, thinking I would be culled, but thank God he passed by, not giving me a second look, and this, itself, was insulting.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I am most grateful when I am never seen in a crowd of people.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca was a man with no sense, and this caused him trouble in his short life. I was surprised he could not find a reason to fight the soldier, as it would have been in his nature. But his test was coming; his hatred of answering questions, and in a few minutes, we would all be in front of an immigration inspector, who would hold Luca’s life in the palm of his hand, like a piece of fruit, but I knew he would still be defiant.     </p>
<p id="page_448" class="calibre6">“I will tell him to fuck off. Is this the goddamned army?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Eat some shit,” I said. “We all like the taste by now, and we are legal.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The first sonofabitch that…”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I grabbed his arm. He stared at me. His face went blank.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Stai zitto</i>,” I said. “Look there,” and I point to the sea. “She is beautiful, the boat that will bring us to America.” *<i class="calibre5">The Antonio Lopez</i>. She <i class="calibre5">was</i> beautiful; not in the way a woman is beautiful, as it had flaws and was not perfect. What did I know? To that day I had not been on a boat greater than the ferry we took across the Strait. I said she was beautiful, but her look did upset me; hull, dented and scrapped, and creased in places at the water line, as if she had been in a great battle, but a freighter is not a fighter. Would she make it a hundred miles without splitting open at the creases?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">And why are boats ‘she’s? This has always bothered me. It seemed wrong to say ‘she’ when speaking of a boat. What woman could make it thousands of miles on the sea. A boat should be a man. I always thought about the great things and I thought on these great things, while the others rested. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The men who build these boats must be gods,” Luca said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The air was cold, and the sharp wind cut through every piece of clothing on my body. I was freezing, numb, and my ears ached, but Luca sweated, and his forehead shined, but he seemed happy for the first time since we left home. Santo stared at the “Antonio Lopez,” and I figure him to be lost in his head.  </p>
<p id="page_449" class="calibre6">“Are you alright?” I ask. He shrugs a sort of ‘yes,’ or maybe ‘no,’ as what can be told from a shrug of the shoulders.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What Luca loves I fear,” he said. “It come to me when I saw this boat, that I am here for real, and I have shit my pants and will shit my pants again.”  I laugh when I hear a man say, ‘I shit my pants.’  Santo always says it, but I have not known him to shit his pants, so it is a good joke and I laughed. Santo drops his head, like he was ashamed. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is my mother, my father. I worry. They are sick. My wife? What if she has trouble. I should not have left her alone.”  It is the beach, again, and I deal with their doubts, and doubts that I keep to myself. The beach? Two days ago, or three days ago, or yesterday?  Santo lifted his suitcase off the ground and took two steps from the line. “Maybe I should go home.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Get back in line,” Luca says, loud enough that heads turned. He pointed to a spot on the ground. “Stand there until I say you can move.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo grabbed my arm, refusing to let go. He was angry with me. “This is your fault…you told me I could do it. You know I am weak, not smart like you, or a fighter, like Luca…I have no balls.  I was drunk that night, nothing more. Now I am sober, and I am here, and things are different. Real, and I am afraid.” Santo whimpered about his life, and Luca, who had enough, shook him hard, so hard I expected teeth to fly from his mouth, like bullets from the barrel of a gun.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You shit of a man,” Luca yells, spitting the words over Santo’s face.  “Here and now make up your goddamned mind.”  Santo grunted and pulled free of Luca’s grip, hitting an old woman as he fell back and knocking her to the ground. She lay stunned and moaning on the wet cobblestone.  I kneel next to her, but she cursed and shooed me away.  I see a soldier, or some harbor guard, running our way, a rifle in left hand, oil lantern in his right. Luca backed a few steps from the line. Santo brushed himself off, and apologized to the women, who was on her feet, but cursing, and wishing us bad luck in America.  </p>
<p id="page_450" class="calibre6">The guard was a full soldier, and out of breath when he got to the line.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What’s the trouble?” he demanded as he took his position square in front of Luca. He asked again, more forceful, more threatening. “Who started the fight?”  No one answered, not even the old woman, who held her wrist and complained of the pain. Our silence made him angry; he asked a third time, swearing it would be the last. He stares straight at Luca.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What goes on here?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Nothing,” I said, calm, like a priest, as I was afraid we would end in jail for fighting in the line.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“An argument between friends…nothing more.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The soldier moves his cold stare on me, and I see his eyes were too close together, and his look made me uneasy (I shit my pants).  This <i class="calibre5">animale</i> seemed capable of anything, as I could tell by the way he stood; he had no discipline, no self-control. His uniform was filthy, worn through in places. He was a lazy man, and lazy men have no pride, no rules they respect, and care little of what other men think. He smelled like a pig sty, or a coral of mules, like nothing I smelled before. His rifle was old, a cast off, maybe French, probably not fired in years, or cleaned. I could see no officer, or other man who looked to be in charge. My advice to Luca, if he asked, would be simple; “<i class="calibre5">Stai attento</i> (be careful).” This man always wins, anyway he can. He is not cunning, or courageous, but a trigger-happy bastard. So, they square off, Luca and this soldier, but neither flinched or breathed heavy, as heavy breathing says fear, and no man is willingly shows his fear.   But the soldier was the first to make a foolish move, an error in judgement; he thrusts his oil lamp in Luca’s face, causing him to step back. “Get the fucking lamp out of my face, you cavone.” The soldier was stunned that Luca refused to submit, like a pail of cold water was thrown in his face, and the fight was gone, and then he was no more dangerous than a man you would meet in the piazza on a pleasant Sunday afternoon. “I want no trouble on my dock,” he says to Luca, who smiled and saluted him like a “wise guy” would do. Luca put his ass down, good, with one sentence, and the guard snarled some, still strutting like a  rooster. He looks around and snarls some more, but he left, and I watched him walk away; not exactly tail between his legs but dragging it along the cobblestones.      </p>
<p id="page_451" class="calibre6">I was tired and hungry, and my legs ached like an old man’s.  I needed to sit, not talk, or think, but sit. Then I feel this bump at my back, from a man I had not seen before, on the ferry or the train. He nodded to me and moved closer, and we touched, and his hand was sweating, so I moved to put a few feet between us.            </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Buonasera,” he said, gently, but too gentle for a man. More like a woman.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is a fine night,” he said. “But too cold to suit my tastes.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He was not an old man, not like my grandfather is an old man, but he looked old. Maybe twenty years older than me, or twenty-five. No peasant, but his suit was shabby, with holes in the elbows and pants near worn through at the knees, but maybe I exaggerate. In all, a safe looking man, of some refinement, maybe down on his luck. Is it possible, I ask myself?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Buonasera,” he repeated, this time tipping his cap, like gentlemen do, and I was  convinced he could be a man of some position, no matter the shabby look.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He asked, “Are you going to America?” as he pulled up his collar against the wind.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, America. Tonight,” and I turned away, as I wanted no more of this conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well,” he said, then paused. “I, too, am going to America. This time to Washington. Have you heard of it?” I nodded I did, and what interest did I have in where he was going?  </p>
<p id="page_452" class="calibre6">“I am *<i class="calibre5">Enzo Baneri</i>,” he said, offering his hand, that I ignored; he let it hang in the air, and finally I took it, for no reason but to rid myself of him.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Have you been to America before?” I asked him.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have, yes, some time ago,” he said, in a way I believe he meant to make me feel inferior. “I enjoyed it very much, the time I spent there.” He sighed. “But now I am from Napoli, a letdown.” His hand was soft, flabby and wet; his grip weak, and I felt sorry for him. Soft hands and weak hands are women’s hands.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am Antonino Sparacino… from Sicilia.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Piacere</i>,” he said, as he turned away. “Excuse my back, but the wind is cold. I am not dressed for it.” I nodded and he nodded.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No matter,” he said, “We are almost to the shack.” The line moved slow, and we were not near the end, but the middle, and I would have been the next man but for the twenty men they put ahead of me.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sicilia? How is it these days?” he asked. Small talk. It is endless and I am tired of it.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Bad,” I said, staring him in the eye until he blinked. “Things are always bad in Sicilia.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How bad?” he asked. “I am a teacher, but also a student and these things interest me. Is that so many are leaving?” He paused to scratch his face, that needed a shave. “Is that what you mean?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Something like it. There is no work, no food and too many politicians. Is that bad enough?”  He nodded.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ah, I see. Nothing to eat…no work…did I say I am a teacher?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, you just said it, and you have my respect.”   </p>
<p id="page_453" class="calibre6">“Should I speak Sicilianu?” he asked, as if I was one of God’s most pitiful creations. “I speak your language…if you are more comfortable with Sicilianu.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Italiano is fine, signore,” I said, hoping that in a few minutes I would never see him again. “I was in the army, two years. I understand enough Italiano, but grazie.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did I say I am a schoolteacher?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, you did say it. More than once.” He rubbed his hands together and shuddered, complaining it was too cold for this time of the year.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “I have taught in Milano and Roma, even London…in England…I speak English, too. American is much like English. I speak American, too.” He touched my shoulder, and I have heard some men do this to seem sincere, and with no bad intentions.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But I tired of traveling,” he said. “I came home to be near family, and to teach the sons of the wealthiest in *Napoli.” From his sleeve he pulled a small, white rag. “Excuse me,” he said, wheezing, as he wiped his nose. “The cold makes me drip, like a leaking spigot.” I never saw a man carry a rag in his sleeve, or have I seen it again, but I guessed it was from London, or some other great city where he had worked. Maybe Washington, in America.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I abhor all the politics,” he said, shaking his head in a way that showed his disgust. “And politicians. They are no less shameful than common criminals.”  He spit on the ground, then excused himself, saying his diner was poorly cooked, and did not agree with him.  “When I disciplined the son of a wealthy man, who was a great benefactor of the school, I was reprimanded by the headmaster, a weakling of a man. ‘Could you be wrong,’ he asked. ‘Or too strict, or unreasonable?’ The boy was slothful, disrespectful to me, I explained this clearly, but the headmaster, fearing reprisals, ordered that I apologize to the boy and his family. I refused, of course, and I became ‘<i class="calibre5">persona non-grata</i>.’ Circumstances demanded that I…”  </p>
<p id="page_454" class="calibre6">“Persona…?  I do not understand.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am sorry. Of course. ‘<i class="calibre5">Persona non-grata’” </i>he repeated, but it was no clearer to me, than the first time he said it. He flutters his hands in the air, like butterflies flying about.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am sorry. Of course. Why should you know what it means? A Latin phrase that translates to, well,” and he thought for the words a peasant might understand. “It means, well, it means I was no longer wanted there, so I gladly resigned, as I could not countenance a waste of my skills at a school that did not appreciate my ambitious standards.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You quit before he fired you?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, I did. On the spot. Within the month I had secured a fine teaching position in America. The children of Italian diplomats.  I have been there before, and it is a better place. In Italia, the children of the rich are spoiled, like their parents. Bastards…all bastards.” He was  embarrassed by his own emotions, the language he used, that did not befit an educated man, who no doubt had read millions of words in thousands of books.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Forgive me,” he said. “But these weaklings have driven me from my country.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I agreed, mostly to shut him up, as I do not involve myself in matters of the rich and powerful, for I am neither and they are devils, who sell their souls for profit. The walls have ears, papa says. “Trust no one.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are correct,” I said. “The rich have ruined Sicilia.” He looked at me, his lip curled, and I believed he was going to weep. “All of Italia. They have ruined it all…everything.”  I felt some sympathy for this man, but in truth I could not be bothered at that moment, as I had my own problems. I turned my back, hoping he would leave me alone, but he was still there when I turned back.  </p>
<p id="page_455" class="calibre6">“Tonight, I am taking the ‘Antonio Lopez,” he said, proudly, as if stepping on a boat was a great triumph. “Like you men, if you men are going to America.” He bent to the side and stretched for a better look at the front of the line.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My oldest brother lives in America.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, that is good for you.” I tried to seem happy for him.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, it is good for me. He is an influential man. I am grateful for what he has done, but I told him I will stay only a few years. For the experience, you understand, to improve my English. The American English. Did I say they speak English in America?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The line moved a half step, and he grabbed his bag, pulling it along the cobblestones. He was a small man, and weak, and every breath seemed a chore, and I thought he might die there, in line. Who was with him? Who was there to care? Alone, at his age. Pitiful. Me? I did not like his fancy words. Latin? Who gives a shit about Latin? No man I know; maybe, Patri Carmine. But something drew me to him; maybe that he was an educated man, and I am not.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I think of America fondly,” he said, with a faint little smile. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She is young… prosperous, with a grand future, but she needs educated men, like me.” Santo and Luca and Antonino? Have we been forgotten, again, left out, ignored, but he caught himself and apologized? “Scusa, signuri. You and your friends…they are your friends, correct?”  He looks straight at them. Santo pulled his jacket tight around his neck. “You are valuable men, too.” Before I could admit their friendship, there was the sharp sound of a ships horn. To a man we stopped and listened, and some put their hands in the air, feeling for the vibration of the horns, that sent a chill down the back of my neck. After the seventh blast, we waited, but the seventh was the last and the line moved forward a few steps toward the office, where a sign with great red letters was nailed to an oak tree. Enzo cleaned his glasses and strained to read the sign.     </p>
<p id="page_456" class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Aspetta fino a quando non sei stato chiamato. Nessun rumore. Nessun problema. </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">Wait Until You Are Called. No Noise. No Trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre6">He looked for more signs, “there is always more than one,” he said, scratching the back of his neck, beneath the frayed collar. He cocked his head and stared straight on at me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Can you read?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Poco</i>,” I answered, not looking him in the eye. When I lie, I am mostly ashamed, unless it is to the boss, or his foreman, or maybe a <i class="calibre5">Carribieneri</i>. For some reason, I could not admit ignorance to this man, who I did not know, who I did not like, who was a goddammed nuisance.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you can read, even a little, that is good news. And your friends?”  He looked to Santo and Luca. “They <i class="calibre5">are</i> your friends? You have not said.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, they are friends…they do not read. We are farm labor. We have no reason to read.” He takes my right hand in both of his and squeezed, his face wore a sad look, that I knew was pity.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ah, so you are all farm labor.” He slapped at the side of my arm. “It is honorable work, and, well, there is no shame in not being able to read. What does the boss profit if you are educated? Want is the <i class="calibre5">quid pro quo</i>.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Quid?  What?  Quid…I do not understand.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Quid pro quo. </i>Latin. It means, well,” he paused. “Something for something.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Did I say he was a short man, very short, and feminine, frail like a woman, and I wondered could he last an hour working in the sun, but I felt inferior to him.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Let me explain <i class="calibre5">quid pro quo. </i>We have time before they get to us.” He smiled and loosened his jacket, saying how bad he sweated, even in the cold air. He kept looking over his shoulder, and moved away from the man behind him, who was standing tight to his back.  </p>
<p id="page_457" class="calibre6">“You, your friends, you work other men’s farms, and you are paid a pittance…<i class="calibre5">miseria</i>.” He was pleased when I agreed, though I was not sure of ‘pittance,’ but I believed it was not a good thing to be paid a ‘<i class="calibre5">miseria.</i>’     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, they pay you a pittance. They would pay nothing if they could.” I was correct, that a ‘pittance,’ was a hair more than nothing and not something to be desired, or could you call yourself lucky if you had a ‘pittance’ of anything. He shook a finger in the night air.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You own what is on your back, or what you carry on your back, but then your back is ruined, and you can no longer carry as much, and you depend on these men for work, therefore your food and shelter.  While you cook in the sun, they drink wine and eat fresh fruit, profiting more from your labor than you. I ask,” and he flutters his hands in the air, once more. “And when you die, you have nothing. They have it all but have not spent one day baking in the sun. Is this just? What does it profit the <i class="calibre5">capu</i> if you are educated?  Think as they think.” He put a thin finger to his head. “When the sweat runs down your back and through the crack in your ass…excuse my language…where are these bosses? Sitting in the shade, demanding more work and better work.” He was preaching, like a priest with a sermon, like Patri Carmine, who was called a troublemaker when he spoke for the workers, but the bishop demanded we work hard and work long days for our wages. Christ said it, and with that Patri Carmine was silenced. I wondered about this man, who says he is a teacher, but stands in line, like me, a peasant and his clothes are worn and tattered, like mine, but worse.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Excuse my rambling,” he says, near out of breath (I believed he was sick).  “I have not talked with another human being for days.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No matter,” I said. “You help pass the time.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Introduce me to your friends.”  </p>
<p id="page_458" class="calibre6">Luca stood with both hands in his pocket; the cold night air, he said. He stepped back, confused, but declaring he would listen. Santo wiped before shaking the <i class="calibre5">insegnante’s </i>hand, who told the story again and the two listened, and when it was over, they were pleased, and he asked, did they agree with what he said. Santo was not sure, admitting the Latin words were confusing, but if it meant he was no better than a slave, this he knew this all his life. Luca had no interest in words, he said, but if this <i class="calibre5">insegnante</i> had advice for dealing with these inspectors, he would be grateful, and this matter of an inspection is what we all feared, for some reason we did not understand.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo agreed. “What do these men want from us? What is there to inspect? Can they stop us from leaving Italia?” Signuri Baneri said he would gladly offer advice, as he dealt with bureaucrats many times before, when he taught the children of rich and powerful men.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The teacher bows his head. “<i class="calibre5">Contrito</i>,” he said. “Be <i class="calibre5">contrito.</i> Speak as if you are speaking to the overseer. It is not important if you are guilty of anything. They will like it.” He explained ‘<i class="calibre5">contrito,</i>’ that it was like ‘<i class="calibre5">rispettoso</i>,’ respectful and humble, like servants, or field workers.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Be ready when you are called. Never make them wait. Never sweat, or they will believe you are guilty of something. They watch for draft evaders, criminals, and other men wanted by the law, and they are rewarded for each capture they make.” He thought, then apologized. “Scusa. I am not certain they are rewarded. I have heard it. But why would they ruin another man’s life, unless there was some reward for them? A good teacher only teaches what he knows to be the truth. Forgive me.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">We thanked him for the advice, as we waited quietly for our turn. </p>
<p id="page_459" class="calibre6">Me? My stomach fluttered. Shit ran up my throat, and it burned, like always and I coughed green spit and wondered what it meant.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Both doors to the <i class="calibre5">Ufficio immigrazione</i> were open; swung back, and the room was like a cave, cut from the side of a hill. Dark, but for three oil lamps, and the dim light cast shadows that would frighten a priest. Every word said, was said twice, as they echoed off the walls. Inspectors? I counted six. Each man sat at a tall desk, in a highbacked chair with an open logbook.  All oak, I believe. It seems a desk and a uniform was enough of a reward for some men to cut your throat. A frightened, humbled human-being stood in front of each desk, over the “x” painted on the floor, and I see the poor bastard standing at desk three wandered off the spot, and the guard in the corner called out, in a harsh voice, “number three…on your mark,” then looked away, so he would not be asked a question, I guessed.  The men on the x’s breathed hard, and I tried to guess who would be the first to throw up, or would it be me while still in line?  No. Number four. He is ready to fall apart. Desk one, nearest the door, was a man who did not speak <i class="calibre5">Italiano</i>, but  <i class="calibre5">tedesco,</i> I believe. German. He searched his papers, that were a mess, and they fell to the floor and scattered. This certain <i class="calibre5">ispettore</i>(inspector)was an older man, wrinkled face and cross, and he leaned across the desk and scolded this man for wasting his time. “Sit down until you are settled,” he said, but the man did not understand, and babbled as he stayed on his knees, gathering papers. The guard lead him to a seat against the wall, but he went peacefully, muttering words in this baffling language. I still think <i class="calibre5">tedesco</i> (German)but Enzo said ‘<i class="calibre5">slavo</i>’ and I had not heard the word ‘<i class="calibre5">slavo</i>’ before, or did I know where ‘<i class="calibre5">slavo</i>’ was located, but it was not in Italia, or Sicilia. I was certain of it.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They should speak Italiano, by law,” the inspector said to the guard. “Si. It must be the law,” and they nodded, happy to agree.           </p>
<p id="page_460" class="calibre6">At desk two, a man and his women were clean and well dressed, and they had no children or other family. She was a nice-looking woman, not beautiful and elegant like Amaria (I was thinking of her. How was she doing?).  I thought good things about Carmela, so I felt no guilt thinking about another woman. As to this woman at the desk, the inspector(an impatient man) demanded her papers. “She has none,” said her man. “Stolen on a street in Napoli…a few days ago…by goddamned thieves.” The inspector slamed the book shut, and his pen rolled onto the floor. “No, no,” he said. He was furious in his manner. “She needs papers.” he said, annoyed she was not ready for inspection. The husband argued loudly in her defense, and this brought a guard from his spot in the corner.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The inspector throws up his hands, in disgust.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Nothing can be done if she has no papers.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">This angered her husband, “papers, papers,” he screamed, “all I hear, papers,” and he pulled his wife toward the door, saying meaningless things, threats and curses. When they passed us, he was scolding his wife for her carelessness. “Two months before we can leave,” he said and she cried, begging his forgiveness, and they disappeared into the shadows, as he continued to scold this helpless woman. Then a noise, a cracking sound, and I believed he slapped her, as she had stopped crying, but started crying again. Italian men can be rough on their women, but not me, not the men in my family.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ignore these people,” Baneri said. “Go. You are next,” and he nudged my back, but I dug into the ground, refusing to move. “You will be fine,” he said. “But I give you this advice, my friend, as I have been through this many times. Never say what you are thinking. Tell them nothing, <i class="calibre5">niente</i>. They are not our friends. What you say they will use against you.” I needed a priest. What could be more important than a man of the Church. Even these barbarians would listen to a priest.      </p>
<p id="page_461" class="calibre6">Baneri whispers close to my ear. “Never show fear,” he says, as if he knew a great secret no other man knew. “They smell fear…like dogs do. And they bite when they smell it. Never tell them a lie, unless it is convenient, and the facts cannot be checked. Lie only if it suits your purpose.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The <i class="calibre5">ispettore</i> at desk six waived me in. I grabbed at Enzo’s arm and asked him to speak for me if I tied up.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiace</i>,” he said. “It is like dying, my friend, you do this alone,” and I understood, and walked slowly into the room, fearing I did something wrong, or an evil at another time and I would be called on it tonight. The floorboards were cupped and splintered, and creaked under my feet, at every step I took until I reached the correct ‘x’ on the floor. The inspector watched me all the way, impatiently tapping a pencil on the side of his desk. The room smelled like lamp oil, though the doors were wide open, and the room was well ventilated. Waste papers and dead leaves swirled in the corners, but no one seemed to care. I counted eight, maybe nine suitcases piled against the back wall. “The owners,” I ask myself. “Where are they?” What happened to these poor bastards that they were forced to abandon their property? I found my ‘x’ and stood on it, now proudly, and I admit feeling good when I obey the rules. It was like the confessional, though I have not confessed my sins for some time. I should have done it before I left home. The Italian flag hung across the long wall behind the inspectors, covered in soot and the corners were torn, or frayed so bad they looked torn. Was it a battle flag from some war? A flag like this flag hung in the piazza, in all weather, day and night, and no one cared to keep it clean. It is not the Sicilian flag, and to us it is nothing more than a piece of colored cloth. There are too many flags, a flag for everything, country flags, province flags, army flags, village flags. Flags, flags, flags. And what do they mean? Shit. They mean shit.    </p>
<p id="page_462" class="calibre6">“Family name?” he asked, in a deep voice, like any other cop. He did not look at me, his face buried in a logbook. He squinted and I believed he needed <i class="calibre5">occhiali</i>(spectacles).      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sparacino,” I said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Spell it.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“S…P…R…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Never mind.” He cursed when the lead in his pencil broke, and he reached across the desk and found another in a cup. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“S-P-A-R-A-C-I-N-O…Given name?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonio.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, signuri. Antonino.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Place of birth?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ali Superiore, Sicilia.” He looked up and nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course. <i class="calibre5">Italian South</i>,” and he wrote it in his book, the way the Americans wanted it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Name of nearest relative who remains in Italia?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Orazio Sparacino, my father.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Final destination?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">L’america,</i> New York.” I watched his eyes. I believed he laughed to himself, but it was a laugh. He leans and opened hand across the desk.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Passport,” he said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was not ready and fumbled like a fool.  </p>
<p id="page_463" class="calibre6"> “Your passport,” he said again, pissed and agitated. “You must have it in your hand, ready to show on demand…on demand.” His point was made, that he was boss, and of this there was no dispute. My hand trembled, as I pulled the goddamned passport from my valise, dropping it on the desk, and he shook his head in disgust. Have it in your hand. Who said it to me? No one said it. If anyone said to me, ‘have it in your hand,’ I would have been ready. Our clerk in the village, *Signuri Mazzi, issued my passport, a man respected for his mild manner and learning; educated in Palermu, I believe. ‘Show your passport <i class="calibre5">only</i> on demand,’ he said.  ‘On demand’ does not mean ‘have it in your hand,’ and I thought on arguing the point with this <i class="calibre5">cavone</i>, but he was more intimidating than anyone I have met, including Luca. He examined the others papers I gave him, sighing heavy, and I believed it was a troubling sigh, that something was wrong, and he had trouble planned for me. Everything went to shit in a short time. He leaned forward, his face a foot from mine, and frozen, like a statue, but I could feel his breath when he breathed.  “How long will you be out of the country?” he asked, his pen on a line, ready to write. I could barely speak, stuttering the words. “A year. Maybe two. No more.  We, uh, me and my friends are going…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Read and write?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, signuri. I do not.” I have lied about this before, less than an hour ago, but I thought it best to be truthful at this time (how would a lie profit me?)  Someone was crying, but did it come from the left, or right, or behind me, as the sounds were tricky and deceitful, echoing off the rough walls. It seemed the sound of a woman, but was it my business?  I refused to look, fearing that to turn away would be an insult to this fool, and he would send me back in the line.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Have you done military service?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Scusa, signuri, I did not hear you.  Someone is…”   </p>
<p id="page_464" class="calibre6">“Have you served in the Italian Army?” he asks, repeating the question when I did not answer fast enough to suit him.  He had a powerful voice, and the room was quiet, and everyone stared at me.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, I served. In the …”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“When and where?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“1903 and 1904,” I said. He repeated what I said. “1903 and 1904.” Then I realize what I said was wrong. Not a lie, but a mistake.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Scusa, signuri…it was only a few months in1903, and all of 1904 and a few months in 1905.” I thought, he did not ask for precise dates, but does he think I am a <i class="calibre5">bugiardo</i>(liar), or a <i class="calibre5">falso</i>(fake), or both liar and fake?     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I served in Sicilia for a few months. Calabria for most of the two years. And a while in this place, around Napoli. I always…”         </p>
<p class="calibre6">“1903 to1905, you say?  In Calabria?” He looks over my discharge papers, for a second time, holding it to the light from the lamp on his desk.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where is the seal? There is no seal on your discharge paper.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe I give you the wrong papers.” I turned my pockets inside out, searching for papers he would find pleasing.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your papers are not official unless they have a seal,” he said, with arrogance. He laid my papers down and folded his hands.  “Without a seal, they are nothing but wastepaper, or” and he smiled, “maybe a forgery.” He cleared his throat. “A man should cherish these papers as proof he served his country. Are you proud of your service?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, signuri, I am proud…very proud…the best years of my life.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He calls an inspector from desk three to examine my discharge papers. He looked them over careful, sometimes glancing at me, and speaking in a low voice, so I could not hear what he said. In my head I planned a way out, if they came after me, through the open doors and into the woods. Nothing but foolishness on my part. The sweat ran in rivers down my forehead, into my eyes, burning like fire, and I thought, ‘what have I done?’ Nothing. You have done nothing wrong. But I hated this fear, and I hated this man for making me afraid.              </p>
<p id="page_465" class="calibre6">“You served in Calabria?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Calabria, mostly,” I answered, looking him straight in the eyes.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Calabria? Calabria is a big place. Where in Calabria?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Cosenza. It is by…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He held his hand a foot from my face, and I see it as a sign I should stop talking.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I know where it is,” he grumbled.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">He looked weary, and I believed he was ready to give up and let me pass. What was I hiding?  Nothing. Was I some big fish to catch and brag about? I <i class="calibre5">am</i> nothing. Less than nothing.  Why bother with a nobody like me?  He moved his logbook to the side, out of the way, and he leaned to me, his elbows on the desk, and he looked close at my face.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My brother, I am proud to say, and God bless him, is an Italian soldier, stationed most of his career at Cosenza. He was there when you were there, or you claim you were there, but you have no good proof of it.” He leans back in his big chair and smiles. “You must know him… *Andrea Natali…a big man, a drinker, I admit, and a good bar fighter, but also an honored and decorated soldier. I cannot count the times he was cited for bravery against the <i class="calibre5">briganti,</i> and those black savages in Africa.” He waited for my answer, with his face in my face. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well?” He paused and tapped on the desk. “Andrea Natali?  Do you know him? You do if you were in Cosenza, like you say.”   </p>
<p id="page_466" class="calibre6">I was standing in a cesspool of fresh shit. I am supposed to know this cavone of a brother, <i class="calibre5">Andrea Natali</i>, who I have not heard of before today, but I played his game and curled my lip and nodded and thought. <i class="calibre5">Andrea Natali</i>?  He wants it. He expects it. It is a benefit of the job, that I kiss his ass, bow and scrape and grovel at his feet. It is a benefit, his reward for being a good and loyal government man.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo</i>. No more.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiace</i>, signuri, but I do not know your brother or have I heard his name before today.” He pulls back from me, to straight up in his chair, a smile on his face, as if he had this <i class="calibre5">contadini’s</i> balls in an iron vice. ‘My balls in an iron vice?’ The thought of it, even today, and my neck sweats rivers.  He stared holes through me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My brother was there…two, three years.  If you were at Cosenza, then you know him. Andrea Natali?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I do not know him, signuri, but I am sure if he is your brother, he was a great soldier.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He stamped my papers. Bang, thump, bang, thump, and laughed. Bang, thump, bang, thump, his hand only a blur in front of my eyes.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have no brother,” he said and laughed. “Sisters. Only sisters. There was no seal on your papers, and the signature is smudged. Impossible to read. But *Signore <i class="calibre5">Albrici</i> pointed out that papers from district did not carry a seal, but he verifies it as a true and correct document.” He sighed and smiled. “It is a shame you are clean. I have not caught enough evaders this year. Anyone with two lire can buy fake discharge papers on any street corner in Napoli. God forbid, even the puttane (whores) sell them to customers. But you passed the test I give when I smell a rat. Liars and frauds, they are all over Italia these days. A liar says, ‘Oh, Andrea Natali, of course, a braver man has not been born, and how is his health? Is he well?  Say ciao when you see him.’ Then I hit him, hard. There is no Andrea Natali, I say, and the sonofabitch falls on his knees and begs, ‘do not call the Carabinieri,’ but I do. Si, it is not a foolproof test, but foolproof enough. And if an innocent man is caught up occasionally, so be it. Eventually it will be found out and freed. A small price to pay to catch the guilty.” </p>
<p id="page_467" class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo </i>to him, I say. Si. <i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo. </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">From the time I could think, I knew someday they would take me in the army, and I would be forced to fight if there was war, for the men who owned all the land. When they came for me, did they ask, ‘is it all right?’ No. No one asked. My name was called as I stood in the piazza. “<i class="calibre5">Antonio</i> Sparacino…step forward and be sworn,” he said. and I did not answer, as I am <i class="calibre5">Antonino Sparacino</i>, and maybe they were looking for some other man. An officer grabbed the list from the enlisted man. “<i class="calibre5">Antonino</i> Sparacino …step forward and be sworn,” he said, and I did, like a lamb to slaughter. I wondered, why they wanted a man such as me, a coward; if I had guts or any courage at all, I would have run into the hills. I hated every day of the two years; more than I might hate the fires of hell.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">On that day, Zia Rosa was in the piazza, watching my ordeal. She was a strong woman who spoke her mind. She went to the Officer-In-Charge, who ignored her, so she grabbed his arm.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do not send him to fight in Etiopia,” she pleaded. “We have already lost men at Adua.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Adua? What do you mean? That war has been over for years.” He stood at attention and saluted the Italian flag shown from the back of a mule cart as it passed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A great victory for the Italiani, no matter what you heard.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I hear this noise, a loud, low voice and I woke from my little daydream.   </p>
<p id="page_468" class="calibre6">“Are you listening?” he says to me. “We are only in February, and I have caught three draft evaders. Cowards, all of them. They will get what they deserve, thanks to me. There was a fourth, but he was a mistake…and unfortunate error, but it was straightened out and no harm done. Just a few months in jail. A small price to pay.” He slid my papers across the desk, and I stuffed them in my poke. “Go to the…let’s see.  Si, the <i class="calibre5">Antonio Lopez</i>. Take a right from here to the ticket office. <i class="calibre5">Buona fortuna</i>.”  He glanced through the open door; “next,’ he said, loudly, and I see Santo on his way in and we were both shaking and shitting and did not speak as we passed.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo stood near the tree where we gathered, smoking a small stogy cigar.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How did it go?” he asked, but not waiting for my answer. He shuffled in place, making arcs in the sand with both feet. He stopped and bowed and looked to the ground.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Would it be possible to travel with you men?” he asked, like some penitent asking forgiveness. “To America,” he added, swearing on his mother’s head he would not be a bother, or cause trouble. “Being a troublemaker. It is not in my nature.” I looked for his hands, but he had dropped his cigar and they were clasped behind his back, and I wondered if he was telling the truth? I believed he might be an annoying man, but his eyes were tired and black, like a man beaten down, maybe the last time. To me he seemed harmless, like a small, but noisy stray dog. A lonely man for certain. “Would your friends agree?” he asked, putting his hand out to me. “We will help each other and do what each does best.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo was done quickly and joined us at the tree; he was shaken, I see, but it was not unusual for him. He pulled his cap over his red and swollen eyes. He thanked God his inspection was done, that he passed, but not without humiliation. “Was I in the army, the sonofabitch asked me?  No? Why not? Sickness, I said, and they do not take sick men. He laughed at that.”     </p>
<p id="page_469" class="calibre6">“Sick, you say. Like the ‘shakes?’ and everyone laughed, even a woman carrying a child.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you give him your papers…they will say you are sick.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, I did. My heart, I explained, is bad. I counted on his sympathy for me, as I spoke <i class="calibre5">in sotto voce</i> (a low voice) so the nosey sonofabitches could not hear, but he kept saying ‘what…speak up,’ and I was embarrassed to go on. He laughed when I showed him my medical papers. ‘Sick?’ he said. ‘You look healthy…maybe you are in the book?’ He kept asking, ‘Is this your passport?  Are these your papers?’  Two, three times the same question.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Book? What book?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The <i class="calibre5">Brutto Libro</i>, the ‘Bad Book,’ he called it. Names of draft evaders and criminals, but I believe he made up the name. I was not in the book, thank God, but I sweated while he flipped the pages. That’s all I know…Antonino are you listening to me?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought I saw Emil D’arrico on the foot path, but no, it was not him, but it looked like him, only taller and he walked with a plain looking woman, not Amaria. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo grabbed my arm.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino? Are you listening to me?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, yes, you did good.” But me? I felt like a dog, not a good dog that a good master feeds well and protects, but a dog that is kicked and beaten until it loses the will to fight back. Let it be over, he says to himself, and then he lays down for good. These bastards who judge us, they call us traitors to Italia.  *Cugino Franco, of my father’s people, said he was ashamed to share blood with me. It hurt what he said, though he is a worthless drunk, a wife beater, but the hurt was more like a bug bite than a club across the head. When I left, he never said goodbye, or shook  my hand, or did he wish me good fortune.   </p>
<p id="page_470" class="calibre6">But everything has changed. </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo </i>to all of them. </p>
<p class="calibre6">They are wrong. No longer beaten dogs. We fight back with our feet.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I say again,<i class="calibre5"> Va' fa' un culo</i> to all of them.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca left the building, no guards at his side, or was he manacled, and I knew it went well for him, as well as anything goes for Luca. He leaned on the post by the door and lit a stogy he took from his pocket; after a few puffs he waved me over.  He had nothing to say, but that he was tired of questions and would not answer another. Never. <i class="calibre5">Mai, mai. </i>Santo reached to shake his hand.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are calm, for you. Did you sneak a drink before you went in?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, nothing to drink…why...do we have wine? </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. No wine.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The teacher? What is his name?” Luca asked.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Enzo Baneri</i>,” I said. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He did me a great service. ‘Be calm,’ he said. ‘Think about things that make you feel good.’ I thought about a woman, mostly. What woman does not matter.” A guard ordered us to move on, too much noise, and we bothered the inspectors, who complained they could not hear themselves think.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Clear the rabble,” was the order. We lingered, and finally the guard threatened us with jail for being disorderly, laughing too loud, and making a spectacle.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Vai, vai</i>,” he said, shooing us away, like farm animals loose from the pen. Luca wanted to fight, but I pulled on his sleeve, and we walked away. Before we went a hundred feet, this carriage came at us from the shadows, run by some maniac bastard who had no intention on missing us.  He was crazy, maybe drunk, or he did not care, and he came so close Enzo tripped and fell to the ground. “<i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo</i>,” Luca yelled to the driver, showing his arm and a middle finger.  “<i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo</i>,” is Lucas favorite curse, his only curse and it is a good curse, and I have used it more than once, but only at the right time and not often, or it loses meaning. Enzo brushed his pants and jacket, and noticing his pocket was torn, he ripped it off. He cursed the rich for the evil they did Italia, and all the landowners and the pezzonovante, most of all.   </p>
<p id="page_471" class="calibre6">Me? I give this bastard the middle finger and moved on with my life.  </p>
<p class="calibre7">**** </p>
<p class="calibre6">The ticket office was a stone building, more a tool shack, run down, not well kept as I expected from a company that owned great ships, mostly made of iron. We follow Enzo through the narrow doorway, and this tall man with a black tie claimed he was boss, but he handled only first and second-class fares. He looked us over, good.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“First or second class?” he asks Enzo.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Third class,” he replied, almost embarrassed to say it. At that we were sent to a timid clerk, sitting at the last table in line; a likeable looking young man, but I wondered, was he old enough to be out after dark. He was dressed like the old men in the piazza on Sunday after church, white shirt and loose, black pants, and the black tie. It reminded me of my grandfather’s Sunday <i class="calibre5">bocce</i> dress. Enzo tapped on the desk, startling the clerk, who wiped his eyes, before looking up from his ledger book.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Buona sera</i>,” he said.  “Welcome to our line, gentleman.” We set down our bags and gathered in front of his desk; four jittery men, sweating shamelessly in the cold. The young man was pleasant enough, but could I trust a man who wears a black tie, except family men on Sunday, or the <i class="calibre5">becchino</i>(undertaker). It is not civilized, and I have never worn one myself or would I, except on Sunday, or at a funeral for someone I liked and respected.   </p>
<p id="page_472" class="calibre6">“Who is first?” he asked, calmly, friendly, and his manner put me at ease. I gave over my documents and passport, though he looked bored with it, yawning wide, that should have embarrassed him, but it did not.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Everything is a…yes, in order,” he said, stamping my ticket, bang, thump, handing it back to me, not once looking me in the eye.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Third Class. The Cabin letter is written on the ticket.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazie, signuri,” I respectfully answered, though he was younger than me.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Third class? What is it?” I ask Enzo as he inspected my ticket.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The cheapest tickets are in the bottom of the boat” he said. “Steerage…a place sometimes below the waterline. Have you not heard of ‘steerage’ before?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Is this true? No one said it. Fish live under the water, not men. I start to worry. The young clerk cleared his throat and loosened his black tie.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The voyage is two weeks, or better,” he said, smiling, as he was not making this trip.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">At this point I feel the air getting thick and heavy, and I could barely breathe. Two weeks?  Could I do two weeks below the water line? I did not plan being with the fish. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo cleared his throat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You men should know, that being in the bottom of the boat can feel like a prison. Are you ready for this?” No laughing, or smiling, but a look; a smirk, maybe.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And the iron hull will make noises, eerie sounds. You will think the ship is breaking apart and some men will panic. I do not know about you.” I sweated, we all sweated and the other two stood in a trance, listening and I believe Santo shook a little.  </p>
<p id="page_473" class="calibre6">“The noises will play tricks on your mind. ‘Will I drown in my sleep’ you will ask yourself?’  Men are driven crazy by the squealing iron, and some will try to claw through the walls.” The clerk stood up at his desk and spoke in defense of his company. He nods to Enzo, respectfully.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What this gentleman has said, well, it is part truth. You <i class="calibre5">will</i> be underwater. Well, for two weeks you will live below the water line…this is better than saying you are underwater for two weeks, and maybe longer, unless you purchase a better ticket for a deck cabin, fresh air and sun. But it will cost three, four times more than Third Class.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He tapped his desk and smiled. “Do you the extra fare?”  he asked. No one answered. This boy I liked at first, was no more than a little cavone, and I was foolish enough to be respectful.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But do not be nervous, signore,” he said, looking at me, but speaking to all of us.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Most passengers travel Third Class. We prefer to call it ‘Third Class,’ not ‘Steerage.’ Steerage, the word itself, reminds of a cattle car, and it is not. First and Second Class are sold to, well, wealthier passengers. But to put your mind at ease, we have not lost a ship for six years…maybe it has been five. I can never remember.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo apologized to the clerk, admitting he had no intention of challenging the good reputation of the company (he did not know the name) that owned the “<i class="calibre5">Antonio Lopez</i>.”  The clerk admitted, though, an accident, an ‘act of God’ was always possible, but he said, for some, the thought of being underwater is worse than being dead. This I understood. Maybe I did. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca says to the clerk, “What about bad rivets?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Bad rivets?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. Bad rivets. Rivets and bolts hold this ship together, correct?” </p>
<p id="page_474" class="calibre6">“Si, they do. You are correct. But I do not understand your fear.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Rivets and bolts made by some cavone, maybe who was drunk the night before?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">The clerk shrugs. “Everything put into the ship is inspected and the chance of a bad rivet or bad bolt is slim, as I understand.” I never gave it one thought until Luca shoots off his big mouth to this boy of a clerk. Now I think to when I am asleep, and a rivet pops, or a bolt breaks off, and the steel plate collapses. The cabin floods and we are dead, but not the rich bastards in the first class, and the not so rich bastards in second class. They stay dry. Better for them, they stay alive. Is it fair? It does not seem fair. Luca takes this kid by the arm and teaches him the meaning of life.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This is why living underwater does not appeal to me. Even if I am protected by iron plates. You say a better ticket is three, four times the price? I am broke.” He points, “And my friends are broke. Desperate, or why the hell would we be here? It is a water grave for me and my friends.” He catches his breath. “What choice do we have? None. No choices. The free men are in the two floors above us.” All through Lucas speech, Santo is shaking his head.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, my friend is right. It is unfair that only the rich travel well. Cabins should be handed out by lots, by drawing numbers, or such thing, not on the size of a man’s poke. All should have the same chance to survive, and who my father is should make no difference.” We mostly agreed to the fairness of what Santo said, but what did it mean, these high-sounding words, because the good cabins were still three, four times the price of the bad cabins and we were broke. Nothing changed. I swore I would come back in First Class, and not carry my own bags or wash my own clothes, and it will be me who knocks down a peasant with a gilded wagon, laughing as I drive away. This time it is steerage. Enzo brought a watch from his pocket; it was fine, shiny and ornate, solid gold, I believe. He claimed, and why would he lie, it was a gift from students he tutored in some language, some dead language, that only a few men speak. I do not remember the name of the language, or where they speak it.    </p>
<p id="page_475" class="calibre6">After some  conversation (Enzo had offered to step away, but we talked in front of him man to man) we agreed to let him travel with us, as far as New York, and he promised, his right hand to God, he would be no trouble, but as useful as we allowed him to be. I felt good about this; the others did, but they bowed to me, as it appears I had become the informal leader of this group. Enzo was grateful, showing his gratitude with a “grazie” to each man. What else did he have to offer?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The boat leaves in an hour,” he said, quietly, as he snapped his watch closed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Then I see her in the corner, sitting and crying, bent over, head buried deep in both hands.  At first, I thought she was a woman, but no, a child, and alone. A small satchel was next to her on the floor.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who is the woman,” I ask the clerk.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Woman?” He glanced in the corner. “Oh, hers. She is no woman. She is fourteen or fifteen, I believe.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why is she crying?” I asked. “Do you know?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She is waiting for her father, coming from Roma, but I do not believe her story. The boat captain may not let her travel alone. I told her this and she started to cry…I believe she is afraid.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Afraid of what?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Everything,” he answered. “Her ticket is good, but she is alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“America?” </p>
<p id="page_476" class="calibre6">“Si. If she has the courage to get on the boat, and they let her go alone. Now it is only her courage that counts.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you going to let her cry?” I ask this clerk, who showed little interest.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Look around you, signore. Is this a church? Where is the alter? The priest? I sell tickets. She must find her own courage, or a man to protect her.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo took a seat next to her; she looked up and they began to talk. At first, she seemed afraid, but he calmed her by what he said, and in a few minutes, she stopped crying and wiped her eyes. She picked up her suitcase and walked slowly to the desk, where the clerk stamped her ticket and pointed to the gangplank, and she asked what time the boat would leave. She thanked him, then apologized that she fell apart and showed her weakness, but she was a long way from home and afraid. Before leaving she thanked Enzo for his kind advice, promising she would pray for him, and hoped they would meet on the boat. She glanced at me and smiled, but otherwise I was ignored. She nodded to the clerk and left quietly. Enzo shook his head as he watched her walk through the door.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Good luck,” he said to her. She turned and smiled, then waved and walked toward the wharf, dragging her suitcase along the cobblestone path. Enzo shook his head once more.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Poor thing. She walked from <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi</i>. A hundred miles away. She is a child.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She came alone.” I ask. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. Her father demanded she marry a man more than sixty years old. She refused, so he drank and beat her in the street in front of the neighbors, for her disrespect. She would rather die, than marry this vile old man, so she said, but she agreed only to make the beating stop. But, as  the days went on and it was close to the wedding, she feigned illness. Enough time for her brother in America to send money for a ticket. She ran away when the rest were working in the fields. Her youngest brother, *Carmine, I believe she said, followed her two miles down the road, pulling at her arm, crying, begging her not to leave. She promised to return some day and take him to America, but she knows it will not happen. Her father would never allow it. She has very little money. Only a few lire. The walk was longer than she figured, and there was food to buy food along the way. It was her good luck when she found a family on the road to <i class="calibre5">Napoli</i>, and they allowed her to travel along, until two of their children became ill and they turned back, and she was alone the rest of the way. She is not much more than a child, but she thought of turning back, and now she is a woman and alone. I said to her, this might be your last chance. If she did not take it, they would find her and force her to marry this old man. You will shape your future by the decisions you make. Of course, she is afraid. A young woman all alone. I promised to look out for her, and I believe it helped to make her right decision.” </p>
<p id="page_477" class="calibre6">She was a young thing, not more than a hundred pounds, maybe. A hundred and ten at the most. Fair, very fair skin, and I do not believe she worked the fields. How long does it take a woman to walk a hundred miles? Four, five days, six days. And not be waylaid, or worse, by the god damn <i class="calibre5">briganti.</i> She is a lucky young girl, as I could see, and fine looking, like my sister *Maria. Their hair was equal and they both had the same manner when they talked and walked. Is that why I am drawn to her? I asked Enzo, did he know her name? He scratched at his chin and looked off. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, she did tell me. *<i class="calibre5">Mascolli </i>is her father’s name. She is<i class="calibre5"> Assunta Mascolli</i>, from <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi</i>, a hill town in <i class="calibre5">Frosinone</i>.” He scratched his chin. “Frosinone. I have been in Frosinone; a poor town, itself, but I do not know <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi</i>. Her family lives in a stable with goats and all the family works the fields, but she is a house servant, and she caught the fancy of the landowner.”  </p>
<p id="page_478" class="calibre6">I wished I could help her, as for some reason I felt a kinship to her, that maybe we had something in common, but she was too young for me and then, what about Carmela? Carmela was waiting for me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">When Assunta disappeared, we figured she found her way to the boat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The D’arrico’s were nowhere to be seen, and this worried me; Emil’s last words, he promised to catch up. A pain hit my gut. It is my nature to believe the worst will always happen. Maybe they decided to go home, or worse, they were waylaid. I asked the clerk if he saw the family.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I pay little attention,” he said. “So many come through here every day.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I described them as a, “a short and slim man, two children, a boy, a young girl and a beautiful woman.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He smiled. “Ah, si. The beautiful woman. Of course, I remember her. Am I dead?” He laughed. “She was here…with a little man, like you say.” He leaned back in the tall chair. “They stood where you are and argued, then left. I wondered what she is doing with the little man; a strange match, as you probably know.” I hid my disappointment and made light of it. “They will be fine,” I told Enzo, who shrugged. He asks, “who will be fine?” We collected our bags, our papers, our tickets, and started for the boat, that Enzo named <i class="calibre5">il grenbo</i>, the womb.” When I see her close up, even the rust and dents and creased iron, she was still grand, like a strong woman and I see why ships are <i class="calibre5">her</i>, not <i class="calibre5">he</i>. My heart beat hard and fast; I was lightheaded, and sick in the stomach. I lied to the rest, saying there was a stone in my boot, and I hobble to a bench, refusing help, though Santo wanted to stay with me, but I waved him away. I take off my boot and pour this imaginary stone to the ground, rubbing my foot vigorously, in case they were watching my little act. In a few minutes my heart right and the sweats were gone, maybe cooled by the breeze. When I dropped my bag and stooped to pick it up, through the bushes I see Emil on a bench, staring at the black sky and talking to himself. I called out his name; he looked around, seeming to be confused. Amaria was next to him, her daughters’ hand in her hand, and the boy, Giovanni, sitting and his feet were swinging in the breeze. Not a care in the world. I pushed through the bushes and walked to them and stood in front of the bench; Emil saw me and looked through me but did not speak.       </p>
<p id="page_479" class="calibre6">“Emil, what is wrong? Are you not going to the boat…are you…are you sick?”  He looked away, as I figured he was embarrassed to be sick, like a woman. A man is never sick at times like this. Never.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you going back?”  I asked. “Is that it?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">His face was red and swollen, as if he had been punched a thousand times.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Home? We have no home,” he said.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria cleared her throat and waited a respectful time. “We have no tickets,” she said.  “It is my fault for what I did.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I stare at Emil, not believing what I heard.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is this true?” my friend.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are bad off,” he said. “Bad off.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But no tickets? But how is this possible? I saw your tickets. Four of them.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, you are correct. We had four tickets. But at <i class="calibre5">Villa San Giovanni,</i> I placed them on the ground in front of my wife, to remind her what we would lose by waiting. For some reason, only God knows why, I never picked them up. They may still be there, but likely the wind took them, and they are in the bay, or someone found them and they will take our place on the boat. I am to blame for my carelessness, not Amaria. She followed her heart and her faith, and it is my fault.”     </p>
<p id="page_480" class="calibre6">How can this be, to suffer for an act of charity? Where was the fairness?      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Non problema</i>. You can buy more tickets,” I said. “This cannot ruin your family.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He shook his head, sadly, as if he had seen the end of the world.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. Not possible, my friend. We are nearly broke...No. The truth of it is that we are broke. Any money to spare went to the priest…the goddamned priest. We have enough for maybe one ticket if I can sell her jacket in the next hour, and the clothes on our backs. No more than one ticket?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria and her daughter sobbed, but her son was quiet, swinging his feet in the wind.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You cannot stay on the bench forever,” I said.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. I know. We are desperate.” He stared at me, like a man dying of thirst, ashamed to ask for a drop of water. Between the three of us, maybe, we had money for one ticket, then it would leave us broke, and what would we say in America, when they ask to see our money; that we gave it to strangers because the mother was foolish, and the father was careless? They will kick our asses back to Sicilia. Then Emil did what I feared he would do. He asked for money, only a loan, not a gift, until America, and his brother would gladly pay us back.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">What does a decent man do when his back against a wall? I lied. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Emil, we have nothing. Not a lira between us, or we would gladly help you out. We are broke, God help us; not enough for even one ticket. We will be lucky if they let us into the country. I said those horrible words that have been with me these fifty years: I am sorry, but we cannot help.”    </p>
<p id="page_481" class="calibre6">He said that we must put ourselves first, and he would do the same thing, but this is why the world is evil and uncaring, but he understood. “This life I wanted for my family, I left on the goddamned dock in Villa San Giovani.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria touched his shoulder, saying he should not curse in front of the children, no matter the reason, and he nodded, but never said he was sorry. I wish to God, he took it like a man, but he cried, he sobbed, and I was embarrassed for him.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why is papa crying,” the boy asked his mother. “Is papa sick?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Nothing to worry about,” she said, caressing his head and shoulders. “We have a problem, but your father will fix it, like always.” Emil was up and walking in a circle, and finally, almost settled and near calm, he took my hand.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">We embraced, “<i class="calibre5">arrivaderci, mio amico</i>,” he said, a faint smile on his tired face. Amaria said good-bye, and waved a small, white handkerchief she held in her delicate hand. So feminine, I nearly wept myself. Then the truth hit me hard, and I was short of breath, that I would not see her again.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Say good-bye to the others,” Emil said, “tell them we cannot go today. Maybe tomorrow. Say my brother was to meet us on the docks, and there is no way to contact him. If by chance you see him, Giuseppe D’arrico, tell him what happened and say hello from his brother and his <i class="calibre5">cognata</i>, Amaria Mastrianno and their children. Tell him we are alright…he should not worry, that we will be along shortly.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will, if I see him. <i class="calibre5">Arrivaderci</i>, my friend” and I walked away and never looked back.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I freely admit that Emil asked for a loan. “We are broke,” I said, “Barely enough to survive.” He understood and apologized for being nothing more than a nuisance, and he was thankful we waited while his wife tended to the injured woman.     </p>
<p id="page_482" class="calibre6">I said nothing to the others, not that they would care, except maybe Luca, who would need another woman to stare at and covet. Anyway, what would I say, that Emil is a stupid man to have lost their tickets, or he is weak and cannot control his woman? They would think him a fool, and he is not. I met the others near the gangplank, among the hordes of people heading to the ship, and I looked at the crowd and realized I knew them all, not a stranger did I see. They were with us on the road to Messina, in the ferry across the straits, in the cattle car to Napoli, and they were brothers and sisters, and we are all from the same family.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo read the sign. <i class="calibre5">“Third Class Cabins. Gangplank 1 and 2.”  </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca nudged me and pointed to a small wagon parked at the edge of the pier, the bastard who knocked Enzo down. Three workers unloaded baggage; in all twelve pieces were brought to the boat on what I saw as a private entrance. The woman supervising was tall and well-dressed, and as I recall she walked elegantly alongside her husband, who was dressed like an important man would dress.  “These people,” I hear her say, “They look mean and hungry and dirty. Could they be diseased, maybe violent?” There were four in her party, including two children, and they boarded the boat on that private gangplank, away from the rabble. I was angry at what I saw; the privilege of wealthy men and women, thinking all, except them. are all violent and diseased and criminal.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I prayed to Santa Agata, that should I die on the boat, or in America, tell my family where I can be collected for burial. Do not leave me to rot, for the birds to eat, and if the boat is sinking, please do not think less of me because I do not help one of these bastards. I will not. No matter. I prayed for Grazia, the woman at the ferry, but I could not recall her last name. Is she still alive and was she worth it? Would she have done it for me, or Amaria and her family, or like the rest, would she have glanced at me on the ground and gone on her way, complaining how reckless I was to have broken a bone and why should she suffer for it?        </p>
