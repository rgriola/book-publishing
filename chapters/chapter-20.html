<div class="chapter-body">
<p class="calibre6">The young girl from Colleberardi was crying, and I seemed to care she was crying, and I wondered why, as I did not know her at all, except I saw her most every day and I remember the story <i class="calibre5">Enzo</i> told, that she told him, that she was beaten by her father because she would not marry an old man, her father’s boss.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Many women cried on this trip, some because they were forced to leave home and family, and they feared the new world ahead. Children cried and men cried.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I stood in front of her, cleared my throat once, twice, when she looked up I believe she smiled, but I cannot swear for certain.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why are you crying?” I ask. “Can I help?” She wiped her eyes and nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Grazie</i>,” she said. “I have been crying for days…no one else has asked, not even the women.” She wiped her eyes again and coughed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have never been away from home before. I am scared to death.” She looked through the room and lowered her voice. “These men, even the ones with women and children, they stare at me, watching every move I make. I do not feel safe down here, but I did not have money for the better room.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where are you going?” I asked. She wiped her eyes, again and took her time with an answer. “To America,” she said. “I mean of course, we are all going to America.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Solo curiosità. </i>I was only curious. After all, what could I do for this young girl?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where will you go in America?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will live with Enrico, my brother. He left Colleberardi for America a long time ago. I have not seen him since.” She was hard to hear, with the hull noises and the talking and all the coughing, caused by the bad air. I lean closer and she backed away, and her hands began to shake. I felt like an evil man.  </p>
<p id="page_654" class="calibre6">“He sent money from America, enough for a ticket and a little food. I have not seen him since I was a young girl, maybe twelve. The last I saw him, he was walking down <i class="calibre5">Via Garibaldi </i>with his friend, *<i class="calibre5">Giacomo Pistonni</i>. I thought he was going to the fields, but no, he walked to Napoli and went to America and has never returned. He never said goodbye, but now I understand, because I have done the same thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">She could not sleep or eat, fearing some evil would happen to her before the boat landed in America. She told me the same story she told Enzo, that her father ordered her to marry the <i class="calibre5">capu</i>, an old man, a drunk who beat his wife, now dead. Signore *<i class="calibre5">Andrea Buccoli</i> is a great landowner in Veroli, who promised her father free rent once they were married, and he would never have to work the fields again. Her father promised his daughter to the old man, who was joyous for reason I do not have to explain, or would I repeat in gentle company.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do this thing for me,” her father asked, respectfully, at first. She refused his request that  she marry the old man. He ordered her, like an officer to a soldier, that she obey his wish. Again, she refused. “He is too old,” she said. “And he beat his first wife and he will beat me.” Her father was a tough man, even for his age, and he fought with <i class="calibre5">Garibaldi</i>, killing men in battle, for which he had no remorse. He seemed pleasured as he beat her in front of the neighbors, and left her on the road, blooding, promising there was more to come. She was lucky, as he beat her bad and the capu refused her until she was healthy. When she had healed, she ate small pieces of raw meat and put a finger down her throat to throw up, and the old capu decided to wait a while longer before accepting her as a wife. The priest, <i class="calibre5">Patri Pazzoli</i>,  wrote to her brother in America, who sent money for passage to America. She told no one she was leaving, or her father would have tied her to a ring on the wall, with the goats, who lived with the family in a stable. When the money came, she left the next morning, when her father and brothers were working the capu’s fields. She packed an old valise, with holes, and said goodbye to her young brother, <i class="calibre5">Carmine,</i> and started on the hundred mile walk to <i class="calibre5">Napoli</i>. Carmine followed her for a mile, crying, pleading with her to stay, promising he would protect her when he grew a little taller. She almost turned back, but she knew her father would beat her again. Maybe kill her. The last memory she will have of <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi</i> is her brother, Carmine, calling her name, and pleading with her not to go, and the last she saw of him, he was sitting in the road, his face buried in his hands. She walked during the day, slept at night in any field she could find, and two nights in an open barn. She lived on bread she stole from her family, and what she could steal on the road. The beating from her father caused her to limp and her leg would swell when she walked too many miles during, so a four-day walk took eight. She hung her head when she mentioned the bread, because of her shame in stealing from the family. If she stayed, though, and she admitted this clearly, her father would have killed her in the end, or worse. Or worse?  I did not ask what she meant. What could be worse than dying, and may years later, I believed I understood.    </p>
<p id="page_655" class="calibre6">Her oldest brother, Enrico, was a good man as she remembered him. He took her for walks, with Giuseppe, another brother. They would stop at the church and visit the priest, and it was Enrico who taught her how to pray. She knew he would be waiting for her when this boat arrived in America.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">She was beautiful and young, and I could not help staring at her, when we talked. I was like a man who had not seen a woman before, but not like the other men she described to me. In my head I was comparing her to Carmela, who I loved, and there was no doubt in my mind. This girl reminded me of my sister, *<i class="calibre5">Maria</i>. Si, yes. She was my sister, and I would look after her, if I could. Nothing more. We talked for an hour, small talk, about this and that, about home and the farms and what we wanted in America. We talked a few more times before we landed in America.  </p>
<p id="page_656" class="calibre6">Luca asked more than once, my intentions, were they honorable toward this young girl. If I was a different man, or not certain of my intentions, I would have punched Luca in the face, but was tougher than me and violent by nature.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">My intentions were honorable, of course, and I believe it to this day.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">She was like me, a field worker, therefore someone else’s property. We both belonged to the man we worked for, but in her case, she also belonged to her father until she married, and she became the property of her husband. *<i class="calibre5">Chattel” </i>is the word Enzo used. It means what I am; what I was born to; a <i class="calibre5">contadini</i> , a peasant, a dirt worker, forever. If you ask me, “what are you?” I say, “I am a farmer,” and I feel good when I say it. But I know the truth, that the farmer is the man who owns the land, and I am his <i class="calibre5">chattel</i>. I was seven years old, or maybe eight, when I started working other men’s land. I carried water for my father, who was the real worker, and I recall the <i class="calibre5">capu</i> saying a thousand times, “I do not pay for the boy…I do not pay for the boy.” There is no complaint from me, because it was honest work and put food in my mouth, and a roof over my head, but the food was poor and meager, and the roof leaked. We worked the capu’s land, my whole family, when there was work, and we lived in his stables, and he paid wages with his left hand and took back most of it with his right hand, mostly in rent that he said was too low and his complain was always that he was going broke(then he bought another hectare of land).   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You complain the roof leaks,” he says to papa.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have no money to fix it unless you take a cut in your wages…”   </p>
<p id="page_657" class="calibre6">Who was this bastard? <i class="calibre5">Carmine DiBlasio. </i>He owned orchards and vineyards in <i class="calibre5">Sicilia</i>, a few in <i class="calibre5">Calabria</i>, managed by his brother, a man of low moral character. I worked for <i class="calibre5">Sig. DiBlasio</i> in his peach orchards. He was cruel with a lira and demanded two days’ work for one day’s pay. I say he was cruel, but not in that way, not like the little girl’s father. He never beat me, leaving such necessary duties to his boss, <i class="calibre5">Aldo Antonucci</i>, a drunk.  <i class="calibre5">Antonucci</i> carried a club in his belt, that he was pleasured to use, but only once on me when I pissed him off, because I was drinking too much water, and “water slows you down,” he said, “and you will piss too much. And pissing takes time.” I remember, it was late at night, dark and the air off the mountain was cold, near freezing. I was tired from stacking boxes of picked peaches, six high. The sixth box was at eye level, and it wobbled and fell to the ground, taking down the rest of the pile. I hurried to pick up the mess. Some of the peaches were bruised and bruised peaches were an <i class="calibre5">infamia</i>, like sin is an <i class="calibre5">infamia</i> in the eyes of the Church. Antonucci went crazy, calling me “<i class="calibre5">imbelcille</i>,” and cursing my mother for raising a fool. He pulled a club and wacked me in the ribs, a glancing blow, because he was drunk and could barely walk. I fell to the ground and doubled up, covering my head in case he went for me again, which was his right, he always said, as he was the boss. My family needed the money, so whatever came next, I would take like a man. He raised his club. I closed my eyes and curled my body, waiting for the next blow. “You sonofabitch<i class="calibre5"> Antonucci</i>,” I hear, and when I found the guts to open my eyes, I see thus bastard,  <i class="calibre5">Antonucci</i> looking into my *<i class="calibre5">zio Paolo’s</i> great, green eyes. He was my father’s brother and the toughest man in the village, and for miles around the village. Zio grabbed for the club, but <i class="calibre5">Antonucci</i> gave it up without a fight, and backed against a tree. He was not too drunk to beg for mercy, and he got it. My uncle was <i class="calibre5">chattel</i>, like the rest of us, but no fool. Still, the bosses were afraid of him. That was the first and last time I was beaten, but other boys, without a tough uncle, were usually treated like lazy, rented mules (these words I learned in America). The boss had the job and you obeyed, and you took what they handed out with a smile. Smiling was always important, as important as the work. I learned at an early age, whatever future I had in <i class="calibre5">Sicilia</i>, I would always be on the ground, covering my head and waiting on the next blow to fall. Being poor and beaten to a pulp, is not a future as I understood what a future should be. I never said it to papa, what I thought, as he would blame himself, and see our miserable place in this world, as his failure. I learned never to trust a boss with a club in his belt, and later, not to trust any boss, and after that, mostly any man.         </p>
<p id="page_658" class="calibre6">I felt sorry for the young girl from <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi. </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">What good could I do for her?  Where would I be tomorrow? </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enough daydreaming. </p>
<p class="calibre6">These bastards promised us time on deck to stretch and breathe clean air and feel the sun. We were ten days gone from Italia(I think ten days, maybe more, or a few less)and we have not seen the sun in that time. Since <i class="calibre5">Napoli</i>. Many were sick with diarrea, the shits, from the bad food, stale water, not fit for mangy mules. No one died yet, thank God, or we have not heard. Me? I have pains in my joints, and aching bones, muscles that burn and a fever, I think. Enzo was certain bones cannot ache, but in this I believe he is wrong, though I never told him so.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Men are angry, they want to fight. Not me, not yet, and in any case I never fight.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was the eleventh day at sea, or the twelfth, maybe eight or nine o’clock at night,  <i class="calibre5">Giacomo Panzinni</i>, from <i class="calibre5">Alcamu</i>, stumbled through our open door, coughing, and he stopped and doubled over to catch his breath.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“There is a fight, on the deck. I saw it with my own eyes…wine…who has wine?”  </p>
<p id="page_659" class="calibre6">No one offered wine and Panzinni went from excited and talking a storm, to angry, saying he would not give us the news, without wine, but he settled for water that smelled all right. <i class="calibre5">Panzinni, </i>was part of the “night watch,” the men who walked the halls at night, until too tired to walk anymore, or the guards sent him back to the cabin. As I could tell, he had no friends on the boat and mostly traveled alone. Me and Luca (Enzo and Santo refused to go)followed <i class="calibre5">Panzinni</i> to the spot where he claimed to have seen it all. Me? I was only curious, but <i class="calibre5">Luca</i> was itching for a fight, and held that <i class="calibre5">Panzinni’s</i> story of a battle as true, and not a story to get other men’s wine. Luca near broke his leg taking the stairs two steps at a time. <i class="calibre5">Panzinni</i> brought us to the hatchway, that opened onto the deck. We hear noises from the other side of the door, that sounded like fighting and when Luca put his ear to the keyhole, some object struck the door hard, and the shock sent him falling back. <i class="calibre5">Panzinni, </i>himself, was startled and fell away from the hatchway, yelling, “mutiny…its mutiny,” like a damn fool. When Luca kicked the door, it only it only vibrated, some. I grabbed his arm, “you will get your head bashed in,” I said, but he pulled away and looked at me straight on, and his eyes were wide and glassy, the crazy eyes of a crazy man. “These bastards are stealing from us,” he said, near spitting the words, and as angry as I have seen him. He would do what he wanted to do, so I stepped away, but he grabbed <i class="calibre5">Panzinni,</i> and together they pulled at the door, and it opened and swung wide. We hear cursing, and other sounds men make, when they are in pain. The boat leaned and the door swung back, but Luca grabbed it and held it. We stood face to face.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you coming?” he asks. I edged to the threshold, but stopped and leaned in and took a look, and it was all black, like a hole in the dark. I backed away.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Listen, Luca, you are…” He stared at me for an instant, then crossed the threshold and disappeared, leaving me and <i class="calibre5">Panzinni</i> standing there, like fools. The boat leaned again, and the iron door started to close. I grabbed it and held it, then let go; grabbed it again and let it go again, and it slammed shut. I stood face to face with <i class="calibre5">Panzinni</i>, who says, in a mocking voice, like the sonofabitch he was, “Your friend? And you let your friend go alone?” <i class="calibre5">Was</i> I a coward? Is that what he was saying? Luca is Luca. I am not Luca, calm, no hothead. I think things over. What is the issue? Is there a good reason to fight?  We are almost in America. I could not see what sane man would see his head bashed in for a stroll in the sun.  “Maybe principle,” Enzo said, but I believed it to be bullshit. Si. I was cautious. If it was a battle we heard, it was a strange battle, but to be honest I never heard the sound of battle before that day. I thought of a battle as men with guns, not fists. Si. I was cautious, that’s all I can say. I know <i class="calibre5">Panzinni</i> was thinking me a coward. I see the look he gave me, the same look I have given other men when they seemed too cautious. Then, and for a reason unknown to me (I later blamed it on the bad air) I decided to join the fight, if there was a fight, but the door was stuck shut, jammed tight. I pulled with everything I had, but it refused to move.  Another pull, harder, my foot against the wall and straining every muscle until I near fainted. I was like a madman, and this <i class="calibre5">Panzinni</i> watched my every move, as I pounded on the door and spoke to it, “open up you bastard…open up.” After a while (I believe he was embarrassed at standing idle) Panzinni joined in. Together we pounded and kicked for a full minute.  </p>
<p id="page_660" class="calibre6">Through this madness, my father was at my ear. “<i class="calibre5">Tu sei pattzo</i> ,” he kept saying and I ignored him. The commotion stops and it was quiet, and the quiet was more frightening than the noise. We waited for ten, maybe fifteen minutes and no one came through the door. I thought the worst, that Luca was dead, or in the drink, or in a jail, if they had a jail. I worked my way back to the cabin, through crowded halls of restless men, but no women, or children. <i class="calibre5">Panzinni</i> offered, of his own free will, to stay behind and watch and report what he saw. Santo was standing at the cabin door, looking battle-weary, as if he had been in the middle of it all. I fell on my bed, like a derelict, and lay there, staring off and wondering, who won the battle, if there was a battle, and what it about? Over sunshine? What else could it be?  But it was night and no sun, or was the sun an excuse? My gut burned with  fear, but I fell off fast, and the next I knew, I was shaking like a leaf in the wind.     </p>
<p id="page_661" class="calibre6">“What’s…what’s happened?” I opened my eyes to the orange and flickering light, and I asked myself, is this heaven or hell?  Did I die in the battle, if there was a battle, or was it all a dream?  It all came back to me, that I had never been in a battle.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I squint to get a better look at whoever was pulling at my arm.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who is it?” I said slowly, thinking the cops had come for me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Luca</i>. It is me, Luca. These bastards are looking for me…I know it.”  He shivered like a sick man; the sweat dripped from his forehead to the floor. He coughed hard, and babbled about ‘men’ and ‘sticks,’ but he caught himself, slowed down and started to make some sense.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It was like a war. Men from the crew had poles they swung hard, bashing skulls.” He coughed, trying to catch his breath. “Blood all over the deck and some men had bloodied faces. They hauled away three or four, and I was lucky to miss their net.” There was a bad cut on his forehead and a bad cut on his right check, both deep and jagged and bleeding. The smell of blood turned my stomach sour. I see blood, or think of blood, and I see death and dying in my mid, and it upsets me.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca was a mess. I had not seen him like this before.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They would not let us on deck, because the better people refused to be there, if we were there and they paid money to see we were kept away.” A young boy, the son of *<i class="calibre5">Giuseppe Rinaldi</i>, came out of the toilet and nodded friendly to both of us. He was deaf and mute and limped, from birth, and some of the men laughed at him and made jokes. Enzo said <i class="calibre5">una cripplea</i> (a cripple) would never be allowed in America. I still  pray for the crippled boy, that his life has turned out all right and he was able to care for himself, and not beholden to any other man.   </p>
<p id="page_662" class="calibre6">Luca kicked the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre6">The cut on his cheek was deeper than I thought, and it opened and blood ran onto his chin, but he brushed it away. “The god damned crates, the cargo, took our place.” He was loud and angry, out of control, but this has been his nature for as long as I have known him. “We live like this for…for…for how many days?  This fucking captain…I want to find this bastard. He lines his pockets, and we suffocate.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I felt shame I was not there to help my friend.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">When Luca settled down, he looked at me and shrugged his shoulders.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where did you go?” he asked, and I believe he thought I was a coward and ran, but it was not the truth. He wanted to fight, he always wants to fight, but only a greater fool would follow a fool into a fight without knowing what the fight was all about. I said this to him, leaving out the “fool,” and it sounded like an excuse for abandoning a friend. “All the noise and confusion. We tried to open the door, me and <i class="calibre5">Panzinni</i>, but it stuck, or jammed, or maybe it locked when it slammed. <i class="calibre5">Panzinni </i>will tell you…we tried.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca breathed deep, as he wiped the sweat from his face.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I believe you, Antonino. If you say it is true. I believe you. You have never lied to me.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But it sounded like war,” I said. “Was it like war? You have been at war. Was it like war?” Luca stared through me; his mouth frozen open.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“War?” He thought, then looked away. “Except for the bastard who blew me up, I  have been at war…only a fight…a god damned good fight.” His eyes went wide as he described it. “They wanted us out because we are steerage, and the crew took a few lire each from the first-class passengers and let them roam at will. I was ordered off the deck, but I refused with some other steerage men. The club served me well.”     </p>
<p id="page_663" class="calibre6">“How did it start?” I asked. Luca shrugged, as if it was of no importance.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am not sure. No one said. I did not ask. But we lost it when they sent reinforcements. Ten…fifteen sailors. Two were the apes who dragged the card player away. You ask who won?  They did. But I got in my licks, a few good swipes in the right places to let them know *<i class="calibre5">Luca Ponto</i> was here. I saw how it was going. I found a spot between two crates to wait it out. Not that I was afraid of those bastards. Believe me. I was not.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">‘I found a spot,’ means he hid. Exactly what I would have done.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He patted his wounds with a rag he dropped on the floor.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca breathed hard and coughed a lot.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We scattered when the bastards took prisoners and dragged them out of sight. I think a few were in bad shape. It was dark, hard to see, but I heard a man call for his wife. He was bleeding from the head. It was all crazy, but I was never scared, you understand. We fought until we could fight no more.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded. <i class="calibre5">Si</i>, I believed him.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I was fearless, but cautious.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I asked again, why the fight?  He said it, straight out, “air,” he thought, but he was not sure, or who was on what side. “It made no sense to me, except I believe they did not want us there, near them for any reason, But I did not want to be a coward in front of him.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Him? Who are you talking about?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Silvio.</i>” </p>
<p id="page_664" class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Silvio Conte</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si</i>, <i class="calibre5">Silvio</i>. He was the first to swing a club, right across the skull of a big sailor, who fell like a barrel of shit off the end of a wagon. I felt good inside, and safe, just watching him, even with swinging clubs filling the air. If he saw me and I did not fight, then he would think I am a coward, and he would never give my pistol back.”  I took his arm.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did he have your pistol? Did he pull it?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca ignored me, instead pointing to where the capu slept, alone, near a corner.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The old man? The capu? Did he make it back? If he did, I cannot believe it. He must have a hundred angels watching over him. When I saw him, he was behind a crate, cowering and shitting his pants. The big shot capu. Nothing but a dirty little coward.” Enzo was listening, but took no part in the conversation, until he hears <i class="calibre5">capu</i>.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is not possible,” Enzo said. “You are mistaken. It was someone else. He is here, sleeping. He has not left this cabin.” He points to a pile of wool blankets and a decent looking pillow. “He has not left here, and you have my word on it.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">But yes, he was gone; we saw it when Luca pulled back the blanket, to see nothing but another blanket rolled to look like a man lying on his side. The old man took pains to convince, even bending the roll in the middle; cocked at the knees, like a men sleep. But the little man, the little <i class="calibre5">capu</i> never came back from wherever he was, and we never saw him again.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo talked to a man from <i class="calibre5">Scafati</i>, near <i class="calibre5">Napoli</i> …*<i class="calibre5">Dipesu</i> was his name, as I recall, or something like it, who claimed he was a veteran of this battle on the deck, but from some other cabin. Santo asked, did he remember an old man on deck that night?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, I do. He was out of place among the young men, who were fighting. I see him running in the shadows, chased by this big man who caught him and dragged him by the collar into full view. The old man tried to get away, but he slipped on the greasy deck. The big man was ugly and brutish, but well dressed and he kept cursing at the old man, saying his time had come and he would pay for what he did. He had something in his hand…it was hard to see…I worried about my own skull at that moment. It was clear he meant to harm the old man, and the old man knew it. A sailor comes out of nowhere and hits the  big man to the side of his head; he went down, but immediately got up and dropped the sailor where he stood. The old man took off into the dark followed by this <i class="calibre5">scimmia</i>, who was laughing...laughing. ‘You have to pay,’ he kept saying. ‘You have to pay.’ And they were both gone. Lost between the crates and the mist.”    </p>
<p id="page_665" class="calibre6">Was this man we spoke of, the <i class="calibre5">capu</i>?  Then he is fish bait, we all agreed, but who shed any tears? In any case, if he was not dead, then so be it and if he was dead, well, who will mourn him, and <i class="calibre5">Sicilia </i>will be better  without him. Patri Carmine would insist this old man is a “child of God,” but Patri is there, and we are here, not there and no one seems to care. The next day there were too many rumors to count. The rumors that most believed said drunken sailors fought over barrels of wine whiskey, or men fought over women. One said the deck was full of dead bodies that were being thrown over the side, one by one. All bullshit. The truth was wrapped up in what we <i class="calibre5">believed</i> to be true or wished to be true. Another story came from a sailor who owed <i class="calibre5">Luca</i> money from a card game and was paying off the debt with information. He said first and second-class passengers bought time on the deck by bribing the officer in charge, who shared this booty with the captain and other officers. A few hotheads from steerage wanted time, but refused to pay, or could not pay, and found an unlocked door and went up against the deck officer and a few of his men, and rough talk and threats turned violent. Thugs were called in to put down the fight, that became a riot that was put down sparing no feelings. *<i class="calibre5">Silvio Conte</i> showed up (the <i class="calibre5">scimmia </i>(the ape) they spoke of,  and by accounts, he picked up a club and sided with the half dozen steerage men who were outnumbered, twenty to one, ten to one, five to one, who knows, but the rebels lost, and the crew took back the deck, and the <i class="calibre5">pezzonovante</i> were allowed their time without rubbing elbows with the <i class="calibre5">plebaglia</i>(mob, riffraff, garbage). The surviving rebels (of which <i class="calibre5">Luca</i> was one) slipped back through the door, into the bowels of the ship. What happened to the <i class="calibre5">capu</i>, the rich bastard, who lived in luxury and dined with bishops, until the horse bucked, and his sweet life ended? Did he die that night, killed by a shot, his cries as he begged for mercy, covered by the noises of the riot and the wind and waves, and his body was chucked over the side, and that was that. This was a guess, as there was no mention of this by any sailor, or officer, as I could tell. The day after the riot, if it was a riot, nothing changed and the capu’s death(if actually dead) was “unimportant of itself.” Enzo’s words. We ate and slept, like before, and played cards in the card room, like before, and worried, what will be our place in America?    </p>
<p id="page_666" class="calibre6">On the second to the last day, or the third to the last day -  a treat from the captain -  hot bread, covered in something melted, that might have been <i class="calibre5">rancido</i>(rancid).  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What is this called?” I ask the cook, a greasy looking sailor from Francia.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They tell me, smother hot bread with something,” he said, then spit on the floor. “There is no name for it, but it is ‘something’ as I was ordered.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was a “reasonable explanation” according to Enzo.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">In the card room that night, we met *<i class="calibre5"> Giacomo Restunni</i>, a heroic man to some, He was a <i class="calibre5">contadino</i> from south of <i class="calibre5">Roma</i>, in the <i class="calibre5">Provincia di Frosinone.</i> His town was <i class="calibre5">Veroli (</i>Latin for ‘truth,’ says Enzo ) somewhere near <i class="calibre5">Alatri</i>. These names meant nothing to me, as I have never been north of <i class="calibre5">Calabria</i>, or have I wanted to, but Enzo said <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi </i>(the little girl’s hometown) was not far from either place.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Restunni</i> did not know her, or her family, but he shared his opinion with the room.  </p>
<p id="page_667" class="calibre6">“She is a foolish girl to make this trip alone, more than a hundred miles alone, and she was not <i class="calibre5">violentata</i>(raped). I cannot believe it” </p>
<p class="calibre6">If I was a better man, I would have sent his teeth to the floor.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He spoke fondly of <i class="calibre5">Frosinone,</i> of her beauty, her fine people and the good family he left behind. He spoke of the farms, that when they were worked right, they had no match in <i class="calibre5">Italia</i>.  Enzo asked him, “was <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi </i>(where the little girl lived) in Frosinone?) He agreed it was, but so small and insignificant, why talk about it, The people were all peasants or criminals. He ended his talk, more a sermon, by saying he was an important man in his town, and it pained him to say goodbye, forever, but he had no choice.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca asked why he left home, catching by surprise; the answer stumbled from his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why a man deserts his country is a private thing, but you will not sleep until I give my answer.” He paused and breathed hard. “<i class="calibre5">Famiglia</i>,” he said. “In one word, ‘family.’ To give my family a better life. I did not want to leave, as <i class="calibre5">Italia</i> is my home…but in this I do not count. I left my mother and father behind, who are old and ill, and I will never see then again, except in the night when I wake in a cold sweat and see their faces in the darkness; for the rest of my life.” He folded his arms and looked toward the floor. The room was quiet, and many of the men bowed their heads, and they were thinking on what he said. I know it.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He said it was his third trip to America, hand to God. The first trip he only looked, like a man buys a mule. The first time you check the teeth, the second time you kick the legs, and the third time, if everything was right the first and second time and it is a fair price, you buy.  On the second trip, he took work on the railroad, and saved a few lire and went home to marry his betrothed, but she was gone, dead from the epidemic and no one wrote( he could not read and he knew no priest). “Imagine my grief,” he said, near tears, “As I walked into my town, past the fountain, under the great arch, expecting her to meet me and embrace me, only to learn she was dead for months. Her father had only weak excuses. No one to write the letter. Who knew where I was in America? The truth, as <i class="calibre5">Restunni</i> saw it, her father despised him, and in some way, the father was glad she had died, for now they would not marry. Of course, they would not marry, and why did Restunni say it?  </p>
<p id="page_668" class="calibre6">I smelled on him the strong smell of a heavy wine; a <i class="calibre5">Sicilian Barolo</i>, I think. He was drunk and homesick and he talked only to make himself feel better. Who has not done this? I do it daily. His grief over his betrothed was short-lived, though, as he married another the same year. A woman he had known since his youth, and widowed in the same epidemic (“ironic,” Enzo said). They had two children, right off, and then he was a family man, and the world looked different.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Restunni said to us, “This is your first trip. I can tell by the way you breath. Heavy breathing, full of fear.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. It is our first trip,” I said, and I looked at his eyes, they came alive, and he smiled.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have experience with these <i class="calibre5">Americani.</i>” He quickly offered his opinion on the America immigration officers, “a lowly and corrupt gang of men,” he said. “Like all men with power, expect they will treat you like shit. They will.” </p>
<p class="calibre8">Enzo laughed, “All of them…everyone is evil and corrupt?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, everyone in my experience. And of course, many of these snakes were born in Italia…like you and me. They are the worst. They have something to prove to the <i class="calibre5">Americani</i>, that they are not rabble, like we are.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Restunni wiped at his forehead. “It is hot down here, like hell must be. Who has wine?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiaci</i>,” I said.  “We have no wine,” and no one offered.  </p>
<p id="page_669" class="calibre6">“Si, I understand.  Did I say that my betrothed died from malaria?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, you did say it. And I am sorry for your loss.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">He nodded, pleasantly to me, made the sign of the cross and went on. I looked at Enzo, who was bored, only rolling his eyes when <i class="calibre5">Restunni </i>spoke. Or maybe Enzo was jealous, or pissed, that <i class="calibre5">Restunni</i> was teaching, and that was Enzo’s place.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“There are rules you must obey,” Restunni said, and with authority, his finger in the air, pointed straight at the ceiling.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Show respect to the men who question you, but never trust them.” He hugged a passerby, his <i class="calibre5">paesano</i> who wished him well in America.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"> Enzo whispers, “he is giving instruction on immigration <i class="calibre5">etiquette</i>.”  I heard this word “<i class="calibre5">etiquette</i>” before, but did not know its meaning, thinking it was a <i class="calibre5">Milanese</i>  dialect. Before Restunni could go on, another man stopped to greet him, and they exchanged words and a hug. Restunni went on, picking out what rules to obey, insisting there were more, many more, but these were the important rules. He cleared his throat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Stand like a man. These bastards look for weak men and women, with deformities...bad bones or a weak mind. An excuse to send your ass back to <i class="calibre5">Sicilia</i>, or wherever you come from.” He was loud and arrogant, like a politician; he was course, and his words went through me, but they drew the attention of the men around us. In a short time, we were circled by, maybe ten men who, for their own reasons, were interested in Restunni’s wisdom, but he was happy to have an audience, and spoke loud so every men in the back could hear. He was like an actor, pointing to every man in the crowed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am fortunate being from the north, because these bastards do not tolerate the southern Italiani. You men, I see in your faces and hear in your dialect, are mostly <i class="calibre5">Siciliani; </i>some <i class="calibre5">Calabrese</i>, and you will not be tolerated as much. I am honest when I say this, we are less than dirt to these people. We are not white to them…white is their cherished race”  </p>
<p id="page_670" class="calibre6">He spit on the floor, and kicked sawdust over the gob to hide it, and he smiled.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And your women, our women, are ‘<i class="calibre5">puttanu’. </i>Whores, no more, no less.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">This, what he said about <i class="calibre5">puttanu</i>, caused some rumbling in the circle and some of the men protested <i class="calibre5">Restunni’s</i> saying ‘<i class="calibre5">puttanu</i>’ when women sat close enough to hear the filthy language. A few of the women blushed and turned away, but most did not, and I do not believe most women knew its meaning. But men who protested, worked through the crowd to the front and they challenged Restunni.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Aspettiamo.” </i>Restunni said, waving his hand across the crowd, that did calm them down and gave him a chance to explain what he said.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They say this. I do not,” he said, and it calmed the crowd.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The northern men, the <i class="calibre5">Milanese</i>, the <i class="calibre5">Roman </i>(who are not really from the north) are somewhat tolerated, thought of as <i class="calibre5">nearly</i> civilized, but not the <i class="calibre5">Calabrese</i> and <i class="calibre5">Siciliani</i>.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You men will be despised,” he said. “Treated like <i class="calibre5">merda</i>…shit.” He claimed this was <i class="calibre5">his</i> experience, <i class="calibre5">his</i> opinion from what he has seen and heard, but our experience might be different, but this he doubted. He wiped his forehead with a white rag, pulled from his breast pocket.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He opened his hands like Christ in front of the many.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Tutti ascoltano</i>” he said in a deep voice.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They let us in to work cheap, to do the shit <i class="calibre5">americani </i>will not do, and for no other reason. They bear us for a while, hoping we leave. They say we stink of garlic and oil, and for this it is all right to beat us and hang us and rape our women. They pay less than nothing wages, and the Americani laborers complain, saying we bring down their wages.” He paused and wrinkled his brow. “Maybe we do, but never forget this, we fill the bigshots pockets with coin, and never,” he pointed each man, “never forget it.”  </p>
<p id="page_671" class="calibre6">There was silence, like at the funeral of a child.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hear me and listen to what I say and remember these rules and you may survive.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I remember how my cousin, Alfredo described the minutes before the battled started, how you could hear hearts beating and shallow breathing and fear, that had its own sound. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Never slouch, like a <i class="calibre5">scimmia</i>(an ape),” he said, bending and grunting to show what he meant.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Never cough or complain about aches and pains...they need us to work. No weakness will be tolerated, or do they want sick women or sick children. This is a cattle auction, and only the strong, or those who look strong, can stay.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He touched his finger to the side of his head. “these bastards will send you back for no reason, as they have millions to choose from. Whole ships are returned because a few passengers are sick. But this I cannot swear to, as I have only heard it.”  </p>
<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre5">*Giovanni Maranzano</i> pushed me aside, and stepped to the front; angry, spitting his </p>
<p class="calibre4">words.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You say I have left my home to be treated like a dog,” and he kicked a chair at Restunni, who jumped quick, and the chair slid past him. The man apologized because he had no control and Restunni said, “no matter,” that he understood.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And now that you know it, my friends, what will you do about it?” He looked at the faces surrounding him. “Nothing,” he said, answering his own question.    </p>
<p id="page_672" class="calibre6">“You will do nothing but follow their rules, whatever they are at the moment. They have  the power and will die to keep it.” Again, he put his finger to his head. “And remember this, always. What will men do to a woman who travels alone, if they the men like shit? Watch your women, like an eagle.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca interrupted Restunni. “You talk more than my grandmother…but she can cook.”  Everyone laughed, except Restunni, whose face turned red from the embarrassment at being compared to an old grandmother, much less a woman.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Restunni threw up his hands.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Laugh if it makes you feel good. But soon…only a few days…you will be their playthings, every one of us. What you look like, what you say, how you say it, will decide your fortune.  America, or your ass back to <i class="calibre5">Sicilia</i>, or wherever you are from. Be like wise men and listen to what I say.” He sat on the chair that was kicked his way, leaned back, and waited for another question. I could not tell if he was a fool, or played the fool for attention, or maybe his own amusement? Everyman who heard him that day, including me, knew, in the back of his mind, he would be the man sent back, if there was any truth in what Restunni said. <i class="calibre5">Pessimismo</i>. Enzo said pessimism is our heritage, almost a cherished custom, from a thousand years working under the yoke of other men. When it can be good or bad, it will be bad, and when it is good, it will only be good for me a short time and forever for other men. *<i class="calibre5">Giacomo Restunni</i> was like a hero for the moment. I may have admired him, in a way, his honesty, if he was being honest. Or maybe he was a fool, and I was the bigger a fool for listening.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Restunni faced the crowd and slapped the table, like an angry man.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He is more of my best advice, <i class="calibre5">gratuito</i>. If you care to listen.”  </p>
<p id="page_673" class="calibre6">“Never tell the truth if a lie suit’s you better.” He looked at the faces in front of him and shook his head. I admit, we were tired looking and <i class="calibre5">lethargic </i>(what Enzo said), but not limp, as every man who was standing, stood straight and tall, and not a cough or a sneeze was heard.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Restunni sat and leaned forward in the chair.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They will ask about money. How much do you have? This is the big question. They demand <i class="calibre5">venti cinque dollari</i>, twenty-five <i class="calibre5">americani</i> dollars, not a cent less. Where do honest men get this kind of money?”  I looked at the man who stood next to me. Did he have it, I wondered? I did not, and I knew Santo and Luca did not. Enzo? I believed he did, as he offered money for the D’Arrico’s, after it was too late to save them.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Restunni cleared his throat.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Whether you are a few <i class="calibre5">dollari</i> short, or broke, never admit it. Say ‘<i class="calibre5">si</i>, I have it. Yes, of course.’  They might ask to see it, and if you do not have it, check every pocket and act the fool. Scream, ‘<i class="calibre5">Sono stato derubato</i>,’ I have been robbed, and your wife and children should cry.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Who believed him? Most believed him, as I said, and we learned he was not all wrong. But I was bothered when he said, “they will treat you like *<i class="calibre5">immondizia (</i>garbage.)”  One man, they say it was a friend of Restunni, said his cousin told the same story, or it was a neighbor who went and came back; he was not sure. Restunni asked again, ‘who can spare a little wine,’ as all the talking and teaching made his throat sore, but he could go on with a little wine.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">A man called out from the back of the room, in a deep voice that echoed, like the room was a cave in a mountain. “You are talking bullshit,” he said. “Bullshit,” the man repeated it, and I wondered who used this vulgarity in earshot of women.  I caught the pained look on Luca’s face as I swung my head around and saw it was <i class="calibre5">Silvio Conte</i> who was challenging <i class="calibre5">Restunni</i> and when he moved in for his kill, the men listening, parted, scattering like chickens, in fear of the fox. Conte strutted, but carried himself well, like some big men do.  </p>
<p id="page_674" class="calibre6">“My zio Carlo,” he said, loud and arrogant, “He was the toughest man I ever knew. He went to America without two coins to rub together.” When Conte got within arm’s length of Restunni he grabbed him with his massive hand and twisted, pulling him close and they and they were eye to eye. Restunni was a tall man, like Conte, but no <i class="calibre5">scimmia</i> like Conte, and I am certain Restunni shit his pants, or it seemed he did, because there was a sudden and foul smell in the air. Like standing in the middle of a pig pen. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You talk to these men like they are foolish little children, to scare with stories of ghosts and evil spirits.” Restunni shook in his boots, and I felt sorry for him, but could not help wondering, did he really shit his pants?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And <i class="calibre5">who</i> is this <i class="calibre5">immondizia</i>, this ‘garbage’ you speak of?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Conte demanded to know this from Restunni, who was still on the tips of his toes. Restunni quietly asked for mercy(he did not beg, to his credit)saying he meant only to educate the men in the room, that we should be ready for the torment due all of us. Conte relaxed his grip, apologizing for his loss of control, and to the few women who stayed, his poor language. We walked backwards to the door, hoping to slip out of the room without being seen. But no luck, as Conte called out Luca’s name.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Luca, <i class="calibre5">mio amico</i>. Are you trying to get away from me?  <i class="calibre5">Vienne qua</i>, come back here, and talk.” Our feet froze to the floor, like thieves caught in the night, and me, I trembled. He pushed his hand towards me, and I took it out of fear, no more, no less. For Luca, there was no handshake, but a great hug and a small kiss on each check. Luca was white and I was embarrassed for him, but thankful it was not me. I said a prayer of thanks, that looking back, was no more than the act of a coward.      </p>
<p id="page_675" class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Aspetti</i>,” he said to Luca, pointing to an empty table. “Let’s talk, my friends.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Was there a better time to lie, but I knew the others would not say a word.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Signuri Conte</i>,” I say, respectfully. “We would like to sit and talk, but we have promised a friend, uh, see, of course, to help him when we land in America.” I stuttered. I sweated. “You see, when he passes through immigration, he will be taking a trip to…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Conte, his head turned sideways, stared me down.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What friend? What trip?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, he is going to, uh, a city …Ci...ci...cicago,” I said.  “Somewhere in America.  Halfway across, I think, to meet his brother and he is nervous. We have to calm him tonight. He is afraid he will be turned away.” Enzo and Santo backed my lie, that we were going to support our <i class="calibre5">pisano</i> in his time of need.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">Conte was not fooled. He laughed. “I am the businessman here,” and he put his arm around Luca’s shoulder, pulling him in, tight. “Are you boys trying to give me the business?” Before I could better the lie, he grabbed Luca’s arm, and what little blood left in Luca’s face, drained away and he looked like a corpse, but worse.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Luca, my friend. I believe you are avoiding me?” Luca could not look Conte in the eye, as if guilty of some great offense.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Ricorda</i>? I am sure you recall the offer I made.  You will work for me; I insist on it. <i class="calibre5">Mi dica</i>. Tell  it.” Luca was like the child and Conte the father, so Luca said nothing. All of us were trapped by this bastard, but it was Luca he wanted, and how was Luca to defend himself, with neither pistol, or muscle to match this man, or his cunning. Luca had no cunning, as Enzo said. I looked Conte over hard, every blemish, every scar on his face, thinking, so this is what a murderer looks like, if he is a murderer? Is the capu dead? Should I ask? If he is dead, did Conte do it?  If he did, he will be proud and say it. But then he might kill me. Thinking this, I changed my mind, that maybe he did not do it. What choices did Luca have? Work for Conte and suffer hell for eternity, if there is a hell (I am sure there is) or rot in jail or die from a bullet in his eye, or behind his year(this is how they do it, I have been told).  Luca could kill himself and become a hero back home, but it is forbidden by the Church, and he will not be buried according to the rights of the Church. Luca and his goddamned pistol. I told him on the beach to get rid of it, but no, instead he pissed in my face, the sonofabitch that he is. Conte grabbed Luca by the shoulders, and shook him, good.  </p>
<p id="page_676" class="calibre6">“You are a real man, a real fighter,” he said of Luca, who was nervous, like a goat, next in the slaughter line.  Conte smiled and squeezed him again.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I saw you work, my friend. How many fucking heads did you bust?” He asked on busting heads, like asking for the time of day. A head? A head is part of a man’s body. Did it did it make a difference to Conte?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, tell me. How many fucking heads did you bust? You bust heads to make a point, is that not right, Luca?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca looked away.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I come in at the end. The fight was near over. And to be honest, Silvio, I am not sure what it was about.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Neither am I. I heard the noise and just wanted to fight, anybody, and it was a hell of a fight. I collected two or three trophy skulls myself.” At this he laughed. “Trophy skulls…I like the sound of it.” Luca pulled up his jacket sleeve and with anger, he scratched at his arm, making four lines that were deep red and raised and almost bleeding. Conte grabbed Luca’s hand, “You will scratch your arm off my friend. I need you in one piece.”  </p>
<p id="page_677" class="calibre6">Luca pulled away and hid his arm behind his back.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is a bad habit I have, and it is made worse by the air down here.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Conte nodded and smiled, “Anyway…I was up there for a walk. I pay off a few sailors who guard the deck and they make sure there is always room for me. MY cabin is good, I pay for the best, but it is small and not for me. Too much like a cell.” He laughed. “But the food up there is better, not like the shit they feed you here. They serve you pig slop, I heard. Is that true?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">No one answered him. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You have been on deck before?” I asked. He laughs. “Si, of course. Every goddamned day. I know the captain does not want the ‘shit from steerage’ mixing with the better classes. The riffraff, he calls you. I was defending you people. Do you understand?” No one replied. He looked around the room. “How can you live like this? Like an animal?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo defended me. “Si, we understand. Antonino did not mean any disrespect.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, si, of course. He meant no disrespect…but he said it.” Enzo, mouth open wide, shuffled toward Conte, who waived him back.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Enough of this small talk. all I hear is small talk. No more bullshit. I need a good man, and I have this Luca in action…busting skulls. So, what is your answer?  Is it ‘yes,’ or will it be ‘yes,’” and he laughed  at his own joke? I should say, for a murderer(if he is a murderer) he mostly laughed and smiled, like a happy man.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Conte grabs Luca’s shoulder. “Answer my question, and I remind you I will accept nothing but <i class="calibre5">yes</i>.” Luca, my good friend, scuffed his right foot along the floor. I asked myself, what is his way out, without he shares the bottom of the sea with the <i class="calibre5">capu</i>? If that is where the <i class="calibre5">capu</i> is?  In case Luca says ‘no,’ refusing to work for Conte, my weight was on the right foot, and I readied a run to the door. Do what is right for you, my friend. I will take care of myself. There was a moment, between the question and the answer, when nothing moved, and we watched each other breathe. Luca rocked, back and forth, while looking Conte in the eye, and Conte stared back. I thought he was going to say, “<i class="calibre5">va all’inferno</i>,” go to hell. I looked to the door; thank God nothing blocked my way.     </p>
<p id="page_678" class="calibre6">Luca never smiled, or did he laugh when he said, “Si. Of course, I will work for you,” and then he repeated it. “I will work for you.” I was shocked he agreed that he would easily give his soul to this murderous <i class="calibre5">Siclianu. </i>For the moment I breathed better, I am ashamed to say.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will do my best for you,” Luca said, and for me, everything changed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Conte grabbed Luca around the neck. “I am sure you will. You are a good man, <i class="calibre5">paesano</i>. You will do well with me. In a few days, after we finish with these <i class="calibre5">cavones</i> at immigration, friends will meet us, take us to the city and we go to work…and together we will make money you never dreamed of.” He whispered something in Luca’s ear, and Luca shook his head, ‘yes’ to whatever was said. Before leaving Conte grabbed my hand, that was wet and slimy from fear, and he squeezed and pumped and pumped four times. Four times. I wondered if this meant something in his business. Four times.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You have a good friend here,” Conte said, speaking of Luca. “You are a lucky man.” Conte snaked(I think it is a word)his way through the room, into the passageway.  I pitied Luca, thinking that he was alone in a crowded room. All alone. My nerve returned as soon as Conte crossed the threshold; I was pissed at Luca and did not spare his feelings.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are <i class="calibre5">pazze</i> in the head…<i class="calibre5">pazze</i>. Now you are working for an animal, and he will kill you…mark these words, my friend. He will kill you, or see that someone else kills you, as soon as he is finished with you. If I could split open his <i class="calibre5">Sicilianu</i> head, what would I find? Nothing but air. Thin air.  You have shamed yourself and your family.”     </p>
<p id="page_679" class="calibre6">“What could I do?” I all he could say. “What could I do?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo boasted he knew Luca would always turn bad; but he never liked Luca and it was like a victory to see him walk into the mouth of the lion. I thought less of Santo for saying it.  Enzo was a smart fish, how he wiggled off the hook when things were hot, that he did not know enough about Luca to make a judgment, but that he may “may have erred,” and did the wrong thing.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Judgment is best left for God,” was Enzo’s wisdom, and now he was a religious and righteous man.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">We left the room, except Luca, who would stay on and look for a drink, or a card game, or both. Wine is good, but a few bad card players, thrown into the pot, would be better. Luca stayed away for a few hours, and when he returned to the cabin, he was calm. I thought it was possible our friendship should be over, but I owed him too much, but not my life, and I was certain he would lose his with Conte for a boss, and maybe pull us into the crossfire., if we stayed close. I always think about the crossfire, being in it. Luca hung over my bed until I acknowledged him. It was a long time.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino, you are angry, but hear me out. I have a plan. I will not kill for Conte. Or be his slave, and I refuse to do what he has for me to do. I swear this to you.” He waited for me to answer. I did not. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Listen to me,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre6">  I looked away, but I could not turn away from him. He was friend, not family, but he never did me harm, or treated me anything less than a brother. I owed him.   </p>
<p id="page_680" class="calibre6">“I have a plan,” he said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A plan? You have a plan? Tell me about this plan you have to beat the devil.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is simple,” he said and smiled. “A simple thing. I fail the immigration test. Say I am sick, fake a limp…go in drunk and throw up. They will send my ass back to <i class="calibre5">Sicilia</i>.  I hear they pay your passage home. Then, in a year or two, Conte will be dead or in jail, and I will come back and join you and Santo…and Enzo, if he is alive and with you.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought, my God, he has the answer. He is genius.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was excited for him; glad it would soon be over.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Swear to them you have no money…it was lost…maybe stolen…hide your papers. They were lost. Tell them you can walk on water. They will think you are crazy, and we will swear to all of it, and they will send you back.” bastard. We will swear to all of it, and they <i class="calibre5">will</i> send you back.” He shook his finger in my face.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will not act crazy. It would follow me like stink.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo furrowed his brow and shook his head. “It will be on the record…they will never let you back. And Conte…he will have you murdered back in Sicilia. It is a bad idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo agreed. “Enzo is right. Once you are in, run like a deer. Escape.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">We laughed at this foolishness. Run? In a strange country? Where? Luca liked it. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Grazie</i>, my friend,” he said, praising Santo. “You have it. I will run like hell.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo tried to reason with Luca. “It is a foolish idea. Where will you go? What will you do? They will hunt you down and shoot you in the back.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. You do not understand this, Enzo. I will not try to crash through or jump ship. I will pass through immigration. Every one of those bastards, Conte and his friends will be taken by surprise. Then I run. Disappear into thin air, like a ghost.  I know where Antonino and Santo are going…Conte does not.”   </p>
<p id="page_681" class="calibre6">It was a foolish idea and I laughed until I realize he was serious and would certainly do it. It could not work, and Luca, my good friend, would be doomed. Conte is too strong, too powerful. Men, like us, poor and weak, never beat men like him. Never. It is not possible.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">For two days no one spoke of the last day. In the end, I thought, if this is the life Luca has chosen(a gun at his head) so be it. A man who does not want to be helped, cannot be helped. Enzo told a story his father told him forty years before, like a parable in the Church, and the bible is full of these stories. “A man is drowning in a river.  A passerby, a decent man, jumped in to save him, risking his own life. The drowning man fought and struggled and kicked, and they both began to sink. “Leave me alone,” the man screams. “I am trying to kill myself and you are ruining it all.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">You cannot save a man who does not want to be saved.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">This is more joke than parable and I have heard it a hundred times since that day. </p>
<p class="calibre6"> I believe I have lost a friend.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought of the little girl from Colleberardi, for what reason I could not say. What happens when she leaves the boat, if her brother cannot meet her, or he has changed his mind? She admits not seeing him since she was a little girl, many years ago. She has mentioned *<i class="calibre5">Bernardo</i>, a friend of her brother, Enrico, who will come with him to meet the boat. Maybe he will come, if her brother does not?  What will she do? I told myself I have a duty to her, because she is weaker than me, and in need of protection.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The last two days dragged on, slower than the rest. Then it was the morning, March 14, America is no longer across the sea, but across the piazza.   </p>
