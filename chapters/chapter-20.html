<h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Girl in the Iron Cave</h3>
<p>The young girl from <em>Colleberardi</em> was crying, and I seemed to care she was crying, and I wondered why, as I did not know her at all, except I saw her most every day and I remember the story <em>Enzo</em> told, that she told him, that she was beaten by her father because she would not marry an old man, her father’s boss.</p>
<p>Many women cried on this trip, some because they were forced to leave home and family, and they feared the new world ahead. Children cried and men cried.</p>
<p>I stood in front of her, cleared my throat once, twice, when she looked up I believe she smiled, but I cannot swear for certain.</p>
<p>“Why are you crying?” I ask. “Can I help?” She wiped her eyes and nodded. “<em>Grazie</em>,” she said. “I have been crying for days…no one else has asked, not even the women.” She wiped her eyes again and coughed.</p>
<p>“I have never been away from home before. I am scared to death.” She looked through the room and lowered her voice. “These men, even the ones with women and children, they stare at me, watching every move I make. I do not feel safe down here, but I did not have money for the better room.”</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” I asked. She wiped her eyes, again and took her time with an answer. “To America,” she said. “I mean of course, we are all going to America.”</p>
<p><em>Solo curiosità</em>. I was only curious. After all, what could I do for this young girl? “Where will you go in America?”</p>
<p>“I will live with <em>Enrico</em>, my brother. He left <em>Colleberardi</em> for America a long time ago. I have not seen him since.” She was hard to hear, with the hull noises and the talking and all the coughing, caused by the bad air. I lean closer and she backed away, and her hands began to shake. I felt like an evil man.</p>
<p>“He sent money from America, enough for a ticket and a little food. I have not seen him since I was a young girl, maybe twelve. The last I saw him, he was walking down <em>Via Garibaldi</em> with his friend, <em>Giacomo Pistonni</em>. I thought he was going to the fields, but no, he walked to <em>Napoli</em> and went to America and has never returned. He never said goodbye, but now I understand, because I have done the same thing.”</p>
<p>She could not sleep or eat, fearing some evil would happen to her before the boat landed in America. She told me the same story she told <em>Enzo</em>, that her father ordered her to marry the <em>capu</em>, an old man, a drunk who beat his wife, now dead. <em>Signore Andrea Buccoli</em> is a great landowner in <em>Veroli</em>, who promised her father free rent once they were married, and he would never have to work the fields again. Her father promised his daughter to the old man, who was joyous for reason I do not have to explain, or would I repeat in gentle company.</p>
<p>“Do this thing for me,” her father asked, respectfully, at first. She refused his request that she marry the old man. He ordered her, like an officer to a soldier, that she obey his wish. Again, she refused. “He is too old,” she said. “And he beat his first wife and he will beat me.” Her father was a tough man, even for his age, and he fought with <em>Garibaldi</em>, killing men in battle, for which he had no remorse. He seemed pleasured as he beat her in front of the neighbors, and left her on the road, blooding, promising there was more to come. She was lucky, as he beat her bad and the old <em>capu</em> refused her until she was healthy. When she had healed, she ate small pieces of raw meat and put a finger down her throat to throw up, and the old <em>capu</em> decided to wait a while longer before accepting her as a wife. The priest, <em>Patri Pazzoli</em>, wrote to her brother in America, who sent money for passage to America. She told no one she was leaving, or her father would have tied her to a ring on the wall, with the goats, who lived with the family in a stable. When the money came, she left the next morning, when her father and brothers were working the <em>capu’s</em> fields. She packed an old valise, with holes, and said goodbye to her young brother, <em>Carmine</em>, and started on the hundred mile walk to <em>Napoli</em>. <em>Carmine</em> followed her for a mile, crying, pleading with her to stay, promising he would protect her when he grew a little taller. She almost turned back, but she knew her father would beat her again. Maybe kill her. The last memory she will have of <em>Colleberardi</em> is her brother, <em>Carmine</em>, calling her name, and pleading with her not to go, and the last she saw of him, he was sitting in the road, his face buried in his hands. She walked during the day, slept at night in any field she could find, and two nights in an open barn. She lived on bread she stole from her family, and what she could steal on the road. The beating from her father caused her to limp and her leg would swell when she walked too many miles during, so a four-day walk took eight. She hung her head when she mentioned the bread, because of her shame in stealing from the family. If she stayed, though, and she admitted this clearly, her father would have killed her in the end, or worse. Or worse? I did not ask what she meant. What could be worse than dying, and may years later, I believed I understood.</p>

<h3 style="font-style: italic;">Chattel and Childhood</h3>
<p>Her oldest brother, <em>Enrico</em>, was a good man as she remembered him. He took her for walks, with <em>Giuseppe</em>, another brother. They would stop at the church and visit the priest, and it was <em>Enrico</em> who taught her how to pray. She knew he would be waiting for her when this boat arrived in America.</p>
<p>She was beautiful and young, and I could not help staring at her, when we talked. I was like a man who had not seen a woman before, but not like the other men she described to me. In my head I was comparing her to <em>Carmela</em>, who I loved, and there was no doubt in my mind. This girl reminded me of my sister, <em>Maria</em>. <em>Si</em>, yes. She was my sister, and I would look after her, if I could. Nothing more. We talked for an hour, small talk, about this and that, about home and the farms and what we wanted in America. We talked a few more times before we landed in America.</p>
<p><em>Luca</em> asked more than once, my intentions, were they honorable toward this young girl. If I was a different man, or not certain of my intentions, I would have punched <em>Luca</em> in the face, but was tougher than me and violent by nature.</p>
<p>My intentions were honorable, of course, and I believe it to this day.</p>
<p>She was like me, a field worker, therefore someone else’s property. We both belonged to the man we worked for, but in her case, she also belonged to her father until she married, and she became the property of her husband. “<em>Chattel</em>” is the word <em>Enzo</em> used. It means what I am; what I was born to; a <em>contadini</em>, a peasant, a dirt worker, forever. If you ask me, “what are you?” I say, “I am a farmer,” and I feel good when I say it. But I know the truth, that the farmer is the man who owns the land, and I am his <em>chattel</em>. I was seven years old, or maybe eight, when I started working other men’s land. I carried water for my father, who was the real worker, and I recall the <em>capu</em> saying a thousand times, “I do not pay for the boy…I do not pay for the boy.” There is no complaint from me, because it was honest work and put food in my mouth, and a roof over my head, but the food was poor and meager, and the roof leaked. We worked the <em>capu’s</em> land, my whole family, when there was work, and we lived in his stables, and he paid wages with his left hand and took back most of it with his right hand, mostly in rent that he said was too low and his complain was always that he was going broke (then he bought another hectare of land).</p>
<p>“You complain the roof leaks,” he says to <em>papa</em>. “I have no money to fix it unless you take a cut in your wages…”</p>
