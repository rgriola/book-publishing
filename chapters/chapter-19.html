<h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Landowner's Escape</h3>
<p>He was noise to me, this man, like an echo in an empty room, over and over; how lazy the <em>contadini</em> (peasants) are, (but not me) always shaking his feeble fist in the air. Louts, oafs and good-for-nothings, who demand too much pay for too little work. He said this and laughed, “You can teach a monkey to dig a hole. My father believed it, and his father, and I believe it.”</p>
<p>There was a fear he admitted to, that surprised me some, and he saw it in a dream, that he is pulling a plow, and poor, like the peasants. “Worse than I imagine hell to be and I wake up soaked in sweat. But it will never come to this,” he said. “There is an order to things that cannot be changed or undone, like the sun rises every day.”</p>
<p>I say to <em>Santo</em>, “Would this old fool have his wealth without peasants? Ask him.” “Ah, forget it. He is a nice old man. It would embarrass him. I will pray for his soul.”</p>
<p>He was old, maybe seventy. Maybe older. My God, I realize he was three times our age, except <em>Enzo</em>; and odd looking, almost freak short, and sickly pale, with the bad limp, and he winced when he walked, but I had no pity for him. None at all. He boasted that he worked like a dog all his life, but his hands were smooth and tiny, like a woman’s hands and there was neither cut or a callous on either. He complained about the smell in steerage, saying back home he would have a hundred women on the floor scrubbing until their hands bled.</p>
<p>“Landowners, like me, have made <em>Sicilia</em> what she is…a part of the great <em>Italian</em> nation,” and he pounded his closed fist, like a child’s fist, against his chest.</p>
<p>“Without us,” he pauses to think, “<em>si</em>, yes, the whole island will sink into to the sea.”</p>
<p>This one day I could not take his hot air, so I ask, politely (he was an old man), “With what you have, why are you leaving <em>Sicilia</em>? And why do you travel in steerage?” With fire in his narrow eyes, he tried to stare me down, but he says nothing. I ask again, but louder and men heard me ask and they stopped, as what man riding steerage would not want to hear his answer, as we were all peasants.</p>
<p>“Why are you, a shit of a peasant, asking me these questions?”</p>
<p><em>Luca</em> stood between us. “But my friend has asked a good question, <em>signuri</em>,” he said, and <em>Enzo</em> touched the <em>capu’s</em> arm. “Yes, it is a good question. Why are you leaving <em>Sicilia</em>?”</p>
<p>The old man stares at the floor, clearing his throat. He looked around the cabin and cleared his throat again. He spoke slowly, as if the words were being dragged from his mouth.</p>
<p>“Well, you see, <em>mio amici</em> (my friends), I do not leave <em>Sicilia</em> by choice…as you people do,” and he points at two men who had moved in close, and he spoke at them. “You are the lucky ones, as I had no choice. You see,” he paused for a long time. “You see, I am a wanted man, fleeing to save his life.” There was a silence, so quiet I could hear the sound of the sounds in my ears; a hiss in one and a ring in the other. The old man coughed, then spit on the floor, but he excused himself. He did not like boats, as he had no control, or did he enjoy mingling with men who do not share the life he was born to.</p>
<p>“You are wanted by the <em>Carribieneri</em>?” <em>Enzo</em> asked. “Did you cross the line, perhaps?”</p>
<p>I thought this was a foolish question, as who knew a rich man jailed for crossing the line? A few <em>lire</em> in the right place and they move the line for him and put it over there, or there, or the other side of town; wherever necessary to make these bastards seem innocent.</p>
<p>“No, not like that,” he answered, staring at the empty faces of the men who listened.</p>
<p>“The <em>Carabinieri</em>?” He laughed. “These are the last people who would cause me trouble,” and he said this with pride, as if they did his bidding. “No. Not government people. A nuisance, at worst. Government men, they all walk with their hands out, as if checking for rain. Always for sale, but they think too much of their own value. Drop a coin on the ground, these bastards will claw each other to death, like rats over a piece of cheese. Or I pass out a few bottles of bad wine…no matter…it is free. <em>Gratuito</em>. Nothing else matters to these <em>mendicanti</em> (beggars). Free. As long as it is free.” He pulls a <em>stogie</em> from his pocket and struck a match on the iron wall.</p>
<p>“What is better than a good <em>Sicilian</em> cigar, or a <em>Sicilian stogie</em>? Nothing is better.” He asked for a rag to wipe his forehead; no one offered, and he used the corner of his blanket to mop the sweat.</p>
<p>“I do not hide from government men because they are easy, they have no pride. If you refuse to pay, they will kill you, but with rules, not clubs and guns, but you are still out of business. No, <em>signuri</em>, this is worse, much worse.”</p>
<p>“Someone’s wife?” I ask, only to be polite, as his age and look made it doubtful his trouble was over a woman, but what man would not welcome the question.</p>
<p>“Someone’s wife?” He laughs. “Let me say it before you ask. It is not someone’s wife, not anymore, I am sorry to say. But there have been plenty,” and he laughed again. “In the old days, she would be left alone while the husband is working in the fields. I might pay a visit to make sure no lonely women was left at home. This was my job.” He paused for a time, maybe a count of ten. “I may have run out of luck,” he said, and he looked terrified. He sighed, loudly, and I was embarrassed for him.</p>
<p>“I fought with gods and lost.”</p>
<p>“God?” <em>Enzo</em> asked, his face twisted, some. “You fought with God?” “No. Not God,” he replied. “The gods.”</p>
<p>Two men, related I was certain because of a similar look, made the sign of the cross and left, as I believe what they heard was blasphemy to their ears. The <em>capu</em> leaned in, “<em>piu vicino a me</em>,” he said, his voice that was shallow and weak and I could hardly hear what he said, or what he meant. A man passed us on his way to the toilet and the <em>capu</em> paused.</p>
<p>“In fact, I believe, they are more powerful than God. Yes. More powerful than God, Himself.” He whispered, “More powerful than God, in their way. God will forgive a man of faith, like me, many times over.” <em>Enzo</em> was confused, he said, rubbing a hand across the back of his neck. When he asked a question, the old man stuck a finger in <em>Enzo’s</em> face.</p>
<p>“These gods I speak of, they never forgive, or forget. It is their nature.”</p>
<p><em>Santo</em> was stunned by what he heard. More powerful than God? How is the possible? If he meant <em>il diavolo</em>, as more powerful than God, then he was a blasphemer.</p>
<p>The old man cleared his throat, and he said it, “I killed a <em>brigand</em>, a <em>Mafioso</em>,” and everyman gasped and moved where the <em>capu</em> sat. At this instant, I felt it clearly, a rumbling in the cabin, and there was terrible vibration, and the hairs on the back of my neck stood straight. My skin tingled and I heard the crack, and it ripped through the ceiling, a bolt of lightning that set fire to the air and no one survived, but the <em>capu</em>. Fake, chicanery, a lie. It did not happen, or any part of it. You see, I am a daydreamer and I imagine that things I think are happening. But I was sure of this, only <em>Mafioso</em> are allowed to kill other <em>Mafioso</em>, and the rule is strict and there are no exceptions. Who did not know a man who disappeared for no more than insulting one of these bastards? Murder one? Death for the whole of your family.</p>
<p>The old man stared at the floor and mumbled, words only he could hear.</p>
<p><em>Si</em>, of course. He was uncomfortable and scared.</p>
<p>“You know what my life is worth,” he said. “Nothing. Worthless. I can never go back to <em>Sicilia</em>. They will see to that.” His eyes teared. “I am wanted, fleeing for my life. What there is left of it,” he said, as he turned away.</p>
<p>“How could this happen to me?” He paused. “To me.”</p>
<p>A man, I did not know, who stood within earshot of what we said, turned pale and gasped for air, but recovered his color and apologized. “The bad food,” he said. “It has made my stomach upset…<em>mi dispiace</em>,” and he left us.</p>
<p>“How did you best these thugs?” <em>Enzo</em> asked the old man.</p>
<p>“Let me get my wits together,” he answered, but he was breathing hard, and he wiped his forehead and loosened his collar at the same time. “It was a month ago…yes, a month…like yesterday. This bastard, <em>Emiliano Pozziano</em>, brother of the local chief, showed up for his payoff. Every month. Three hundred <em>lire</em>.” When he said, ‘three hundred <em>lire</em>,’ there was a great gasp from the men who listened. “But it was worth it, I admit. These bribes and payoffs kept the peace, and the peasants in line, working and following orders.”</p>
<p>Three hundred a month from one landowner. I make five or ten, when times are good.</p>
<p>“He collected it, every moth for more than a year, and always surly when he came to pick it up. This this time he was drunk, <em>umbriaco</em>, and he laughed in my face when I handed him the money. ‘The price is six hundred starting today,’ he said. I laughed.</p>
<p>“No, too much. I cannot pay.” We argue over the price, but it is important for me to say this, that he had all the power. I had nothing.</p>
<p>“ But you are a rich man, and your brother is powerful,’ I say to this bastard, as I am a reasonable man.</p>
<p>“Not rich enough,” he said, “And I am not my brother.”</p>
<p>I throw up my hands and refuse to pay another <em>lira</em>, not one more.” The old man slapped his chest, boasting on his defiance.</p>
<p>“My crops were failing from drought and disease, rotting in the fields. My best workers were leaving for America, goddamn their souls, or Argentina. God knows where else. Good riddance, I say. The ones who stayed, the old ones, the ones with no future, who mostly cannot pick for more than an hour without stopping…even the sick and lame were demanding more money, for less work. Am I well off? <em>Si</em>, I admit it? Does this make me evil man? If I was an evil man, would His Excellency, the Bishop, <em>Vescovo Altieri</em>, honor me at the <em>Festa</em>? No, of course not. But I have my limits. Who will pay my bills and feed my family? I have a right to my profit. The Church says so, and all the priests and bishops, and the other landowners have a right to their profit. It is the way it must be, commanded by the Lord, and this is why I refused this bastard. Honor. I was defending our honor, that is, the honor of all the landowners. <em>Pozziano</em>, this bastard swore and cursed, then tells my workers…the ones not driven away by this pompous sonofabitch, that he would make an example of me.” The old man was honest at that point, admitting he shit his pants at the threat. <em>Luca</em> smiled, as I believe he was enjoying all that he heard. <em>Santo</em> cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“You should have run like a deer,” and to this we agreed, except <em>Luca</em> said nothing.</p>
<p>One of the men in earshot, stood up, “my feet would have scorched the ground,” he said, and showing no shame in saying it. The <em>capu</em> nodded.</p>
<p>“<em>Grazie</em>,” he said. “I feel that supports me. I understand what you say, but I felt invincible, like a young man feels. And all my people were watching and listening. I thought, would he hurt me with all the witnesses? But this good feeling was not a reasonable, and it lasted until he dragged me by the neck to the back of a wagon; his intention, I believe, was to bash my head on the steel wheel. Not to kill me but cause me pain and humiliation in front of my workers.” He pauses to catch his breath, causing an annoying quiet. <em>Giuseppe Morro</em>, from near <em>Catania</em>, took a small (only half full) bottle of wine from his valise, and offered the <em>capu</em> a drink, “to calm your nerves.”</p>
<p>“<em>Grazie</em>,” he says, taking the bottle and drinking it dry; he wiped a sleeve across his lips, and he returned it empty. <em>Morro</em> stared at the bottle, and I believe his eyes teared.</p>
<p>“Forgive me,” the old <em>capu</em> said, seeing the disappointment in <em>Morro’s</em> face. “I will replace the wine when we land in America…with only the best.”</p>
<p>A man and his boy, from <em>Cefalu</em>, I remember, come from the toilet, and the father nodded as he squeezed between the <em>capu</em> and the wall. The boy, who was maybe ten or twelve and polite, smiled and excused himself as he passed, and we all saw his teeth were rotting in his mouth.</p>
<p>“Your workers…your men…did they help you?” <em>Luca</em> asked. The old man laughed, coughed up and spit on the floor.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, shaking his head. “They cheered <em>Pozziano</em> on. The sonofabitchs cheered him on. Can you believe it? After what I did for these filthy peasants who fuck their mothers.” Now <em>Luca</em> was furious; he stood, his fists clenched into tight balls and hidden behind his back. I grabbed his arm and he relaxed, some. “I am taking a piss,” he said, pointing at the old man. “I will see you later.” As he left, he kicked the side of the old man’s bed roll, and this, of course, startled him, as he did not expect this show of anger.</p>
<p>The <em>capu</em> looks straight at me. “Your friend is a hot head. Tell him I meant nothing personal.”</p>
<p>“I will not apologize in your place,” I said, and some man, I did not know, called out the <em>capu</em>, demanding he should apologize to every man who ever worked for him, and there was agreement among those who were listening.</p>
<p>“Of course. I understand. Things were done wrong, and I meant no harm, but as I said…” I wanted none of his apology, as I believed it would not be true and sincere.</p>
<p>“Finish you story. You survived this <em>mafioso’s</em> beating.”</p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, I was lucky. God, Himself, was with me. When I resisted <em>Pozziano</em>, it angered him like I have seen no man angered. He took a knife from his back pocket, and he was going to kill me, as he grabbed my neck with his arm and pointed the knife to my eye. But at the very last moment, and I thank God for this, the horse, a great chestnut, who could pull three wagons, bucked wildly, and the force broke <em>Pozziano’s</em> grip on my neck and he slipped and fell under the wheel. It was the will of God and a frightened horse, that did it. Not me,” and he makes the sign of the cross. “I saw my chance to run, and I took it…who would not? For some reason, that to this day I cannot explain, I slapped the chestnut on the ass, hard, and he bucked, and the wagon rolled over <em>Pozziano’s</em> neck, snapping it clean. I heard it, like a tree limb breaking. Crack. I looked. His eyes were open, and he stared at the sky. He seemed to be dead, and I was alive. Thank God.”</p>
<p>He made the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>“The sound of his neck snapping…that sonofabitch…it will never leave me, and I pray for his soul every night. I was the lucky one that day, but it sealed my fate. I am always afraid, wondering if I will be alive tomorrow.” He sweated like a work mule in the sun, as he relived and retold the incident.</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>“I grabbed the reins and quieted the horse. I look at <em>Pozziano</em>, and the death stare on his face. I near threw up.”</p>
<p>“Your men?” I ask. “What about your workers?”</p>
<p>“They ran. The cowardly bastards.” He shook his head, “After all I have done for them.” “What did the <em>Carribieneri</em> do?” <em>Enzo</em> asked.</p>
<p>“The <em>Carribieneri</em>? Are you <em>pazzo</em>, <em>signuri</em>? I took off up the mountains. For the next week I expected to be hunted down and caught, like an animal, and they would cut off my hands and feet before they…” He stopped, he would not say it, what they would do to him in the end. “I froze in the hills, but I suffered more thinking about my own death. I thought of nothing but staying alive.” The men who listened, seemed to have little sympathy for this man, as I could tell by the looks and my personal feeling.</p>
<p>He told an interesting story that passed the time, but nothing more.</p>
<p>No one cared. Not me, or <em>Luca</em>, or <em>Santo</em>, or the men in the room. Fuck him.</p>
<p>“After days and nights in hiding, like a common criminal, I made it back to my <em>villa</em> in the middle of the night and gathered what I could carry. My <em>cugino</em>, <em>Alfredo</em>, and God love him for what he did, helping me escape to <em>Napoli</em>. I hid in the back of his horse cart, under a pile of piss-soaked straw, like an animal, myself. I was suffocating. Like a fool I raised my head for fresh air, and as luck would have it, at that moment we were passing two of my workers standing idle at the side of the road. They saw me, and one of them, I could not tell who, threw a rock at the cart as it passed. I knew this, they would inform on me. I worried for my <em>cugino</em>. I knew these bastards would find him and make him talk and finally, and mercifully, kill him. He refused to leave with me. He was needed by his family, he said.”</p>
<p>He made the sign of the cross, and I added it to the count I was keeping on the fingers of my right hand. Five times.</p>
<p>“He was my father’s favorite nephew…God help him…but he knew the risk, and I admit I would not have done it for him if our fortunes were reversed. Now, I am hiding, like a common criminal, guilty of nothing more than defending myself. But they will get their revenge if they find me. What am I to do?”</p>
<p>“How did you leave <em>Sicilia</em> so fast?” I asked. “Your papers? Your passport?”</p>
<p>“Papers?” he laughed, leaning in to pat my knee. “No…no papers. <em>Lire</em>…I dropped <em>lire</em>, <em>i soldi parlano</em>, money talks,” he said, as he put his hand an inch from my nose, rubbing his fingers together. “<em>I soldi parlano</em>,” he repeated and smiled. “<em>I soldi</em>. It is the real language of life, and all of <em>Italia</em> speaks it well, with no dialect that I have ever heard. No confusion in it. Ever.”</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> touched the <em>capu’s</em> shoulder, like a friend. “Your family? Are they in danger?” The old man teared as he spoke about the sweetness of family, but I felt nothing for him; no pity, no sympathy, as men like him are born ruthless, with the instinct to kick ass and now he was old and powerless, soft and fat in the gut; not much of a man. He cried, rivers of tears, and, I admit, it was no matter to me. <em>Santo</em> offers him a rag; at first, he waved it away, but when offered again, he grabbed it and wiped his face. My God, he was shameless. I would have run and hid and suffered alone, at least they would say I was a man. He finally straightened himself.</p>
<p>“You ask about my family? And I thank you for that courtesy.” He looked straight at me, but <em>Enzo</em> had asked the question.</p>
<p>“Nothing is more important than family…not wealth or power. My youngest son is in America. I have his letter and I will find him, wherever he is. My oldest son is in <em>Milano</em>. We fell out years ago. He said my ideas were not his ideas. I believe he is ashamed of me. Why I cannot say. I have given him everything.”</p>
<p>He wiped his forehead and the back of his neck.</p>
<p>“My wife is dead, five years now. <em>Febbre tifoidea</em> (typhoid fever). It spread like a curse, across my farms. The peasants died first, in droves. So many I had to import workers from <em>Calabria</em>. They were no better; no cleaner and they began to die. There filthy ways near put me out of business.”</p>
<p>Who listened to his plight were <em>contadini</em>, the men who made him rich, but he never stopped insulting on the way we lived? “Fuck him,” I think to myself, but this sonofabitch would not stop whining. “Poor me.” Fuck him, again.</p>
<p>“In the end, the disease killed my wife. I survived, but only by the will of God, and prayers from <em>Patri Colasanto</em>…a great man.”</p>
<p>I look at his eyes. What did I see? Did I see a child of God? I am <em>Cattolico</em>, mostly a believer, when it is convenient. I am an honest <em>Cattolico</em>, <em>papa</em> says. What is my duty to this man, even as I despised him and his kind? When he looks at me, does he see a man, or a <em>scarafaggio</em>, a cockroach? He does not see a man. He has said it. He deserves only what he deserves, no more. My question is this, if all the men he cheated and beat into the ground and denied a better life, if they were his jury, would they hang him?</p>
<p>If they would hang him, and I believe they would, what duty do I have? None as I see it. “<em>Scusa</em>,” he whispered. “I misspoke…when I said peasants, I did not mean you or your friends…not you personally. I mean, well…I am sure you understand.” There was a moment, a tick of the clock, that I near felt sorry for this pathetic, old man, with the little hands. Almost. But the truth is that nothing, no curse or insult from my lips could serve me better than his grief and fear. <em>Patri</em> would say, “<em>Antonino</em>, you are not a good <em>Cattolico</em>. Say three Hail Mary’s and make a good Act of Contrition.” Then what is this little man? His kind have all the money, the power, the best seats in Church, but now he is like me, worse, and I am enjoying his suffering.</p>
<p>Make a good act of Contrition is what <em>Patri Carmine</em> would say.</p>
<p>The old man shifted in place. “Nothing would suit these bastards better,” he said, “Than seeing me hang in the <em>piazza</em>…these <em>animali</em>. They will look for me, everywhere, but they will never find me. They are strong in the back, but dumb in the head, like <em>animali</em>. What I did was an act of God. If He did not want it to happen, it would not. Who can argue with God or the nature of a dumb beast, like a horse?”</p>
<p>He slapped his chest. “I know you men hate me for what I have, but look at me, closely and you see a man who has outsmarted all these bastards.” He clenched his fists. “Hard work. I took my father’s wealth and turned it into a fortune.” He pointed at each man still in the room. “And you, and you, all of you could have done the same thing. Work hard. Make money, and when you have money, you make the rules. It is the way in <em>Italia</em>. If you fail, it is because you are a failure as a man and lazy.</p>
<p>He had spirit in the face of great odds; but he was a dead man, and we all knew it. “Maybe they already know where you are,” I said. “Your <em>cugino</em>? Maybe he was convinced to talk before they slit his throat, if they did. I would have talked, no doubt,” and most of the men in the room agreed with me.</p>
<p>“I thought of it,” he said, with great confidence. “But he knew nothing, but that I was going away. Believe me, I trust no one. Even this fine man who gave his life for me. God rest his soul,” and he bowed, and made the sign of the cross. The sixth times. Maybe the seventh.</p>
<p><em>Pozziano</em>, the old man, looked straight at me, “did you hear something?” he asked, his eyes searching through the cabin, fast, like the scared little man he was. For all he said about courage, his fearlessness, he was mortified scared (<em>mortificato paura</em>) and gleaming beads of sweat fell from his forehead, over his thick, grey brows, into his eyes and he squinted and tried to wipe them dry. I trapped myself, as it was me who let him speak in the first place, but what did I care?</p>
<p>He took my arm, but I pulled away.</p>
<p>“If you hear something,” he said and stopped. “<em>Scusa</em>, but I do not know your name.” “<em>Mi chiamo Antonino</em>,” and I smiled, mostly since his problems were not my problems.</p>
<p>He nodded without smiling.</p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, <em>Antonino</em>. My eldest son is <em>Antonino</em>. My youngest is <em>Gennaro</em>.” He sighed. I have seen neither boy in years,” and he became quiet and looked away from me. “If you should hear something…I am certain you will not…you will let me know?”</p>
<p>“Of course, <em>signuri</em>,” I said. “Whatever I can do to help.” This is what I said, but yes, it was a lie, and in truth I did not care what happened to him, or his sons. Some might say those who pursued him had a right to their due, their revenge and some would pay to see him suffer. Me? What did I know? He is one of them, or he was before he murdered the collector, and he made honest men his victims, and he inherited from his father who did the same, and his grandfather who probably no better a man. Now he claims he is a victim, crying for justice. It was not the bribe he complained about; he paid freely for years, but the new price; it was too high, and there was the problem. Not what, but how much.</p>
<p>From the middle of this gathering of men, a weak voice, barely heard above the engines and the heavy breathing and the coughing. A young man, tall and trim, stepped into the aisle; at once I could see innocence in his face.</p>
<p>“If they find you, you can ask for mercy,” the boy said, and the cabin went quiet. He was ready to say more, as I could see, but the <em>capu</em> raised his hand.</p>
<p>“What is your name? Where are you from?”</p>
<p>“<em>Andrea Salvi</em>, from <em>Camastra</em>, in <em>Sicilia</em>. My father is <em>Giuseppe</em>.”</p>
<p>“Where is he? Point him out. I want to see the father of a fine young man, like you.”</p>
<p>The boy bows his head. “We were going to America together, but he died in his sleep, a month ago. I go alone, for no other reason than to honor his name.”</p>
<p>“You do honor his name,” the <em>capu</em> answered. “But they will show me no mercy.”</p>
<p>He was once a king who commanded men, deciding their future and fortunes; now he sleeps with twenty-eight <em>contadini</em> and an <em>insegnante</em>, and it must be unbearable waiting for the sword to fall, that he knows will come soon. After all, what do they profit by showing him mercy?</p>
<p>“But to you, young man, good luck in America. Do you have family there?”</p>
<p>The boy cleared his throat. “An uncle, sir. My father’s brother. But I do not know where he is, or if he will welcome me. I plan to be on my own.”</p>
<p>The <em>capu</em> nodded his head.</p>
<p>“If times were different and I was not a hunted man, I would have work for you. I might even help you make your future. But now you have a greater future than I do.” He buried his face in his hands (I do not say he wept, but I believe he did) not that I cared for this wretch of a man.</p>
<p>“Fuck him to hell,” is what <em>Luca</em> said about him. The <em>capu</em>, I mean.</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> leaned close to me. “Listen,” he whispered. “<em>Pozziano</em> should meet <em>Conte</em>, and for a price I am sure will protect the old man, like a bodyguard. At least until he gets to America.” I turned away, but he took my arm, like <em>papa</em> did when he was serious, and I listened.</p>
<p>“Maybe the old man exaggerates the danger, hoping for sympathy.”</p>
<p>We stared for a long while. Finally, I said it, as honest as I could, “I do not like this old man. He is on his own, as far as I care.”</p>
<p>“Because he is rich?” <em>Enzo</em> asked.</p>
<p>“No. There are decent rich in <em>Italia</em>. I have…”</p>
<p><em>Luca</em> interrupts. “They must be hiding,” he said and laughed, and <em>Enzo</em> laughed.</p>
<p>The old man whined on his misfortune (<em>sfortuna</em>), as he said in <em>Sicilianu</em>, but I refused to listen anymore. I sought peace in the shit house, but the foul smell (not cleaned for two days, I think) set my guts rumbling hot. When I returned the old man was gone and the rest were about their business. <em>Enzo</em> was fighting the latch on his suitcase, jabbing it, hard, with a bent nail he found on the floor. <em>Santo</em> and <em>Luca</em> were sleeping, or dead; it was hard to tell in that place.</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> gave up on his suitcase and went to his bed.</p>
<p>I shook <em>Luca</em> hard until he opened his eyes. He was groggy, not happy to be bothered. “What do you want?” he asked, rolling away from me.</p>
<p>“<em>Conte</em>? Where does he sleep at night?”</p>
<p>“Uh, what do I know? But not down here. Maybe the other side of the ship.” “Have you seen him?”</p>
<p>“Not since the other night when he…”</p>
<p>“<em>Enzo</em> says we should tell <em>Pozziano</em> about <em>Conte</em> and he can hire him for protection. What do you think?” He rubbed at his eyes.</p>
<p>“You mean that old bastard who never shuts up?”</p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>. <em>Pozziano</em>. The <em>capu</em>. You were just talking to him.”</p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, <em>Pozziano</em>.” He paused to think. “<em>Conte</em> would not be interested.”</p>
<p>“The old man murdered a <em>mafioso</em>,” I said. “They will kill him slowly. I trust no one. I thought that maybe <em>Conte</em>, himself…”</p>
<p>“You think <em>Conte</em> will protect him?”</p>
<p>“Why not? For money. He is a thug.” <em>Luca</em> sat up, rubbed his eyes and laughed.</p>
<p>“You are <em>pazza</em>,” he said, pointing at his own head. “<em>Conte</em> is here for one thing, <em>i grandi soldi</em>, the big money, not to be a bodyguard to a useless old man because he once owned a few acres of dirt.” He rolled over and shut hus eyes.</p>
<p>I felt foolish, that <em>Luca</em> was right. What would <em>Conte</em> want with an old man like <em>Pozziano</em>? <em>I soldi</em>. <em>I soldi</em>, cash, this is why he is going to America. What does dignity and family mean to people like him? Nothing. <em>Niente</em>. <em>I soldi parlano</em>. Money talks. He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Let me sleep. And dream like you do. Anyway, what do I care? What do you care?”</p>
<p><em>Luca</em> was right. A dead <em>capu</em>? A dead <em>mafioso</em>? What difference did it make to me, as long as I am not in the crossfire? They chose to live this way. What happens to the old man, happens. May these bastards rot in hell for what they have done to my family.</p>

<h3 style="font-style: italic;">Life at Sea and the Search for Air</h3>

<p>We were at sea for a week, maybe more, eight days; who can say? Maybe less. Looking back to the first day, now I am sorry I did not make marks, like a calendar, on the wall. Three men did it; they scratched lines, a slash for each day, but there were three accounts of the time; five, six or seven days. Who to believe? Only one was right, so who was not full of shit? The three men who kept the accounts argued on who was right and who was wrong, and each claimed to be right, and one threw a punch and so did the other and it took four men to break it up the three. Over scratches on a wall. The <em>cavone</em> who threw the first punch accused the other two of missing a day, or adding a day where none should have been added, and so on. I believed the time in the middle, six days, for no special reason; but was it worth fighting over and I had no wine to make me fearless, so I shut my mouth.</p>
<p><em>Luca</em> stops a sailor, who did not want to be stopped, and asked how long we were at sea; a simple question, I thought. “Why?” was the sailors answer, but <em>Luca</em> had no answer for the sailor’s answer and told him, ‘Never mind.’</p>
<p>We were dead tired from doing nothing, and we spend most of the day under the blankets, or on the floor, but we tried not to sleep, until it was time to sleep, so not to pace the halls all night, like some men did. In the small talk, I ask <em>Enzo</em>, would he teach me a few words of English to help me in America, until I can learn on my own. He claimed he spoke good English like a good Englishman, though I never heard an Englishman speak, or would I know the sound of English, since I never heard it and never knew anyone who spoke it, as I recall. He agreed, offering the same to the others (and maybe read and write, a little) but <em>Santo</em> and <em>Luca</em> passed, because <em>Luca</em> did not care and <em>Santo</em> believed it was only right to study <em>Siclianu</em> first, and anything else would be an insult to his family and <em>Enzo</em> offered no argument the other way. In all, I decided <em>Enzo</em> was a patient man, and I believed all educated men were patient, as this was part of their education. Not so, I would learn.</p>
<p>I was no good student, as I see in the look on <em>Enzo</em> face, but then he taught the sons of the best men in <em>Italia</em>, not peasants. I stumbled over the same words a hundred times, and I see his frustration, how quick he lost interest in what we were doing. He always pated my arm as I tried to read from the small book he kept in his pack; not many times, but three or four and then he gave up and I was glad he did.</p>
<p>“You are doing fine,” he would said, not meaning a word of it, and the look on his face was disappointment; he told the truth, I am afraid, and I see this look today, and many times over.</p>
<p>“You will read like a gentleman from <em>Roma</em> in no time,” he said, but there was no seriousness in his voice. In any case, the thought of being Roman did not appeal to me, but I did want to see the great city someday, to see where the Romans in my unit were from and why they acted like cattle most of the time. One night, near the end, <em>Enzo</em> was upset because I could not remember English words I see a thousand times. He would tighten his fists in anger.</p>
<p>“You cannot recall these simple words, because your mind is in the fields, turning dirt,” but he would catch himself and smile and say he was joking, and we were good friends. I knew it not to be true. At first, I was insulted, but his words grew on me and made sense in the end, that what the <em>contadini</em> have done in a thousand years, is survive. No peace, no success, but survive. If I was born wrong, then what is the purpose of being born if you are born wrong? Work like a mule until you fall, and they will like the mule because it was a good example to you. At your funeral they will say, “A fine man. A hardworking man,” and all will agree; but who means it, or cares that it might be true, or, God forbid, a lie? I said I would not think anymore, until we made it to America, and then, maybe, I would see things different, but I prayed I would never call anyplace home, but the mountain that bore me.</p>
<p><em>Santo</em> thought <em>Enzo</em> might be sick, as he asks again and again, the name of our ship, in the morning, again in the afternoon, and sometimes at night. When <em>Santo</em> said it is the “<em>Antonio Lopez</em>,” <em>Enzo</em> said he was a fool, that none would name and <em>Italian</em> boat after a <em>Spaniard</em>.</p>
<p>We did not see <em>Conte</em> for a few days, as I recall, and it was good, but we only traded one enemy for another. Boredom is a different enemy, not violent, like <em>Conte</em> is violent, or greedy, like the <em>capu</em> is greedy. Of <em>Conte</em> and the little <em>capu</em>, who is the worse of the two men; the man who will burn in the deepest part of hell?</p>
<p>A week has passed. I think a week. I have not seen the sun in days, or breathed air not fouled by the smell of piss and shit, or have I washed in water that was not gray. Is this the best it will be? What do I know about America?</p>
<p>“Suffer a few more days, maybe a week,” <em>Enzo</em> said. “What is this small inconvenience against a better life?”</p>
<p>He made sense, if there is a better life to come from this. Me, I wanted a guarantee, and I say it should be in writing, but <em>Enzo</em> will have to read it to me, and I believe he has lost patience with my ignorance. The first day on this boat, a sailor pointed to the door. “You are cabin one,” he said, very politely. “Remember your number.” <em>Grazie</em>, we all said, and bowed, believing such a low number was an honor, and in some way, we might be special. <em>Enzo</em> said it meant nothing that we were not two, three or four, or five, if there is a five. He must have thought we were fools, right off, from the first day.</p>
<p>To the toilet, to bed and back to sleep.</p>
<p>A little food, here and there. The shit they serve or what <em>Luca</em> steals.</p>
<p>Small talk. All the time. Who gives a shit what other men think about anything? “This is what life is,” <em>Enzo</em> said. More small talk.</p>
<p>No different than babble in the <em>piazza</em>, over a cup of wine.</p>
<p>We ate what they served, exact, at one o’clock, precise; we marched, like soldiers to the dining room, but it was habit, not their rule. The meal was the same, thin, flavorless soup, boiled potatoes, never pasta or bread or meat, not once. A boat full of <em>Italiani</em>. What sense did it make? My father and grandfather would not eat, he would starve unless my mother made pasta with rich sauce from fresh tomatoes. Did it make sense? Be patient, make no noise or complain; never push in the line, because they tell you to leave, and you must go, or they throw you out, and you miss the meal, as bad as it was going to be. A plate and a cup, maybe a fork and wait. When a table emptied, a sailor waved us in. “Eat fast and leave,” he would say. We stood close to the cook table (plate held at the waist) and panted, like dogs waiting for food and water from the master. A flinch, a sneeze or a turn of the head, and your food is on the floor. Pick it up, eat it, or be hungry. Only one pass to a man, or a woman, or a child.</p>
<p>If a child dropped his food, the mother and father did not eat, unless they took it away from another poor bastard, and he did not eat that day.</p>
<p>“Yours is on the floor,” I heard more than once. <em>Luca</em> would sneak into the night and brought back small chunks of meat, maybe a fresh tomato, or two, and twice scraps of bread, and once a full loaf. This is how we ate. We were thieves.</p>
<p>A sailor, a man with three stipes on his sleeve, for whatever it meant, patrolled the narrow isles between the boxes called tables, checking for <em>malingerers</em> (<em>Enzo’s</em> word) who try to stay after the meal and talk, and he would kick the chair. “Move on, your meal is over,” he said. A dirty look? Simple, no need to think; leave, make room for the next man. Here we saw characters who never left their beds, except to eat, or wander the ship in search of nooks in which to hide. The young girl from <em>Colleberardi</em>, always showed for the meal, at the right time, but she never left her bed at any other time, except for the toilet, although we never saw her go, but she had to go, at least a few times. I wanted to meet her and talk with her and hear her story, if she would tell it. Maybe if <em>Enzo</em> is with me. The old man has respect. Why is she here? Where is she going? A young girl, alone with strange men, is something not seen in <em>Sicilia</em>, and thank God for it. <em>Enzo</em> said she a hermit, who draws into a cave when he senses a danger. There were, maybe, five or six hermits in the cabin; all men, except the young girl, and even the men looked away if you tried to speak to them. We met a <em>Siclianu</em> the first day, who never left his bed, but to eat and shit and wander at night, and he would look the other way or stare at the floor if you said <em>bongiorno</em> and he never answered. This certain day he was in line behind <em>Santo</em>, who invited him to eat with us if we could find the space for five. The hermit agreed, admitting he had tired of eating alone. The hermit, who was an old man, ate heartily, and wishing he could go back a second and third time, claiming the food was the best he ever had. “If they let me, I would spend the rest of my life on this boat.” <em>Luca</em> said to this hermit, who was <em>Alfonso</em>, this ship was like a prison.</p>
<p>“Do you like prisons?” he asked <em>Alfonso</em> straight out.</p>
<p>“If the food is good,” he replied, without hesitating. He admitted he was an <em>abandonat</em> (a derelict), back home, born, like us, to a <em>contadini</em> family; well respected among other <em>contadini</em> families, and known to be hard working and no complainer, until he saw the truth. One day, the <em>capu</em>, who had no other choice, sent <em>Alfonso</em> to the next town with a load of fruit to sell in the market. It rained along the way, and he took refuge under a stand of chestnut trees.</p>
<p>Lightening hit a tree near where he stood and it was like God spoke to him, he said. It was clear, then, that working for a wage was an insult to God; a waste of life, and not what the Almighty intended. He abandoned the cart and the mule and the fruit and walked until he came to the <em>Chiesa di Santo Rocco</em> and fell asleep in the back pew. <em>Patri Gerolamo</em>, pastor of the Church, woke <em>Alfonso</em> the next morning and they prayed together, with <em>Giovanni Mastronni</em> and his wife, who attended morning mass, and each gave him a <em>lira</em> to help with a “new start.” Three <em>lire</em>. More than he earned in a good month. ‘Why work?’ he thought, so he spent the next two years begging on the streets of <em>Messina</em>, and in the end, he saved enough money for passage to America, where he was told the begging is the best in the world. At night, when everyone slept except other hermits (he counted ten), <em>Alfonso</em> walked the empty corridors to pass the time until he fell asleep. We listened to what he said, but he talked shit about this and that, nothing worth hearing, but between a mouthful of boiled potatoes and dry beans, he said how he enjoyed the deck, and the cold night air; alone, or mostly alone, except for the other hermits and night walkers.</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> was taken back. “The deck? It is not possible. The doors are too well guarded.” “No, <em>signuri</em>, you are wrong. I do it at will. And other men do it.”</p>
<p>“I am like Thomas,” <em>Enzo</em> says. “I must always see the wounds, then I believe.”</p>
<p>“Wounds? <em>Non capisco</em>. But I swear it is true. A spot near the wheelhouse. The door is closed but not locked…for the crew, I think. It does not look like a door, and the guard is usually drunk and asleep. Easy to get by him. I have seen the freight stored on every square foot of deck space, and these crates are stacked three and four high, from the front to the back of the ship.</p>
<p>They leave a space along the rails where the better class of people are allowed to walk and sun themselves. And we are in the cargo hold, choking on filthy air. Is it right? Does it seem right to you? We are <em>immondizia</em> to these people. Even the thought of touching sleeves sickens them.”</p>
<p>At this point, he tired of his story, and tapped the table with his knife, and pointed to <em>Santo’s</em> plate. “<em>Vostri fagioli</em>? Your beans? Will you eat your beans?”</p>
<p>“Take the beans,” <em>Santo</em> said. “They taste like wet cement.” He told a handful and dropped them onto <em>Alfonsos</em> plate, who smiled and thanked him. When the beans were gone he stood and wiped his mouth. “<em>Ciao</em> and thank you for sharing your table,” he said, politely, and left. The story this hermit told spread like fire, as <em>Santo</em> and <em>Luca</em> told anyone who would listen, and if they told any man already discontented and dissatisfied, he became furious. The younger ones, the hotheads, <em>Luca</em> and a few others, wanted to fight. This talk of violence worried me as I am not a fighter, and would have gladly ignored everything, and suffered in silence as I always did. Was it wise to take the word of a hermit, a man who wandered the halls at night when everyone slept and slept when everyone walked the halls? Tempers were red hot, but <em>Enzo</em> was a convincing man, and they listened to his plea for sanity.</p>
<p>“What is your answer?” he asked the hotheads. Battling armed sailors made no sense, he argued, and they agreed, except <em>Luca</em> and a man from <em>Messina</em>, who was by his appearance, a roustabout, who spoke like a common criminal. <em>Enzo</em> would “petition the captain.” he said, with all his confidence, and make some “accommodation,” but who understood what he meant?</p>
<p>“I will speak to his humanity, telling him the hardship he causes.” His manner, his way of speaking to men at the edge, was calming, except for <em>Luca</em> and the other hothead, but when their allies vanished into thin air, they thought better of going it alone and went off grumbling. <em>Enzo</em> never spoke to the captain, or any officer, or did he intend it when he promised, and in his confession to me (when he explained “accommodation”) admitting only that he wanted to stop any trouble, but not be marked as a troublemaker.</p>
<p>I believed the talk of violence was not serious talk, but it bothered me, and <em>Santo</em> was shaken by it. “How did you and <em>Luca</em> talk me into this?” was the first thing <em>Santo</em> to me when the hotheads were gone. The closer we sailed to America, the more he thought he had made a grievous error, and we, his friends, were responsible for his poor decision. We threatened him, he said, but when asked ‘how’ he could not recall; maybe we shamed him in front of his wife, his family, saying he was not much of a man if he stayed home. None of this was true, but he felt good when he could blame someone for choices he later regretted.</p>
<p><em>Santo</em> is my <em>cugino</em>, we played together as children and worked together when we became men. He asked me one day, would I work for <em>Alfonso Tuzzilli</em>, who was a man of means, and owned olive orchards throughout the province, but a hated man. <em>Tuzzilli’s</em> regular crew was late from <em>Messina</em> because of mudslides, and it was possible the olives would spoil before they could be harvested. <em>Tuzzilli</em> was a slave driver, who paid less and demanded more than other landowners, but he had the work, or most of it. <em>Santo</em> worked for <em>Tuzzilli</em> because his family needed the money. This is what he said, but I knew him well, even then. He enjoyed watching <em>Tuzzilli’s</em> youngest daughter, a fair beauty, who was known to swim in a stream that went through the orchard and enjoyed teasing the men while they worked. <em>Tuzzilli</em> walked the orchard with a cane and with a vicious dog, that snapped at the ankles of the workers and <em>Tuzzilli</em> laughed, even if he was sober. He said in the <em>piazza</em>, he could hire half the village to kill the other half, and my father was there and said it was true, and that marked <em>Tuzzilli</em> an evil man, and he never paid what he promised to pay. All this to be near a young girl, who might swim in the stream.</p>
<p>I did not want to work for <em>Tuzzilli</em>, or did I know about, or care about olives.</p>
<p><em>Santo</em> pushed hard. “You shake the tree. How hard is it to shake trees? You shake and I sleep; you sleep, and I shake.” A good scheme, he believed, so I agreed to work, after he raised is right hand to God reminding me we were family and he would certainly do it for me. It was too hot and humid for October, not a cloud for weeks and the sun cracked the rocks, as the old men say. Between shaking and sleeping, we ate good goat cheese and drank wine drained from his father’s oldest barrel. <em>Santo</em> was drunk this one day, and fell into a sound sleep, under an oak tree. <em>Tuzzilli</em> showed up to check our work (he was supposed to be in <em>Messina</em> twenty miles away) and there lays my <em>cugino</em>, <em>Santo</em>, asleep, propped against a tree, the spit dribbling down his chin, onto his bare chest. <em>Tuzzilli</em> was famous for fits of anger; what he saw under the tree was not a drunk, but <em>lire</em> floating into thin air. He cursed like a wild man and let out enough rope that his bitch dog stood on <em>Santo’s</em> chest, growling like the devil, spit flying from both <em>Tuzzilli</em> and his dog. He fired the both of us, and refused to pay for the time we worked, almost a week, as I recall clearly, though it was many years ago. How do I tell <em>papa</em>, a man who respected honest work and honest working men, that his oldest son was fired for his part in a fool’s scheme to cheat the boss, so his cousin could be near a woman who might be naked?</p>
<p>I will tell you about <em>Santo</em> with a story.</p>
<p>“It is your fault,” was <em>Santo’s</em> claim when he sobered up, that he was allowed to drink too much wine and allowed to make foolish choices. He swore his father (my uncle) beat him severely for being fired, but I never saw a mark or a bruise, and I figured his story was a lie; this is <em>Santo</em>, my <em>cugino</em>. As for me, <em>mama</em> never told <em>papa</em> I was fired, but he heard it, and my penalty was the disappointment on his face, that I still see today, though he has been dead many years. For weeks after, if <em>mama</em> needed water, she went early to the fountain to miss <em>Tuzzilli’s</em> wife, who went there to relax with her two servants. <em>Mama</em> and <em>Signuri Tuzzilli</em> were friends of a sort, though her mouth was unbearable, and she cursed and insulted and threatened like a man. In time, when they met and spoke, not a word of this incident was ever said. Two years later, almost to the day we were fired, <em>Tuzzilli</em> croaked, his family claiming he died behind the plow, a hardworking salt of the earth to the end. We heard he kicked a mule who was too old, too tired to work, but young enough to kick back, splitting <em>Tuzzilli’s</em> head wide open. His wife sold the mule to uncle <em>Pietro</em> for five <em>lire</em> and we fed it pieces of potato when we could and brought it water from the stream, and the animal was honored, until caught in the field during a violent storm, and a bolt of lightning tore it to pieces.</p>
<p><em>Santo</em> has always been a nervous man; at the least annoyance he will chew his fingernails, and I cannot remember a time when they were not bit down to the flesh. He has never felt joy in his life, I am certain and even in the act of living in the day, he saw everything as a catastrophe, and he was always be depressed. His fear if he was asked to take a walk in the <em>piazza</em>, what if you trip on a loose stone? I am surprised he joined us in this trip, and more surprised he stayed, and I know this, in his mind he has gone home a thousand times since we left the mountain. <em>Enzo</em> has gained some sway with <em>Santo</em>, becoming his confessor, like a priest, as <em>Santo</em> respected his education and wisdom. Since we left home, maybe the last seven or eight days. <em>Santo</em> has been troubled by a dream. His wife, <em>Agata</em>, she appears to him, naked, walking the streets of the village, like a whore, offering herself to the <em>capu’s</em> and the workers, no difference. “I curse the bitch,” she says to <em>Santo</em>, until he is almost crazy. Who is this ‘bitch? What did she mean? He calls her name in the night, “There is no woman…no woman,” and his body thrashes about like a stuck pig.</p>
<p><em>Santo</em> described his dream, but forgetting the nakedness, the cheating; these finer details I hear from <em>Enzo</em>, who could not wait to betray a confidence. No <em>Siclianu</em> would admit his wife’s betrayal, even in a dream, and no <em>Sicilian</em> wife would be unfaithful, even after years of separation, and she will always stay pure, untouched by any other man. This is the story we tell, no matter. <em>Santo</em> sought out <em>Enzo</em>, because he is an educated man.</p>
<p>“What can I do?” he asks <em>Enzo</em>, who listened respectfully. “This dream…it is killing me…I am afraid to sleep” <em>Enzo</em> was the good priest, with a good priest’s way, nodding at the right time, saying the right words for a troubled man to hear, but what can be said to a man who dreams his wife is whoring, night after night? It leaves no room for pleasant talk.</p>
<p>“Do you believe your wife…I mean, do you think she betrays you?”</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> asked the question, cautiously, picking the right words; men are murdered because they have picked the wrong word, or used the wrong tone of voice. <em>Santo</em> wrung his hands, as he looked through the cabin, sweat beading in the furrows of his forehead.</p>
<p>“No…of course not,” he answers harshly to the question. “She is a pure and virtuous woman. A God fearing...a <em>Siclianu</em> women...the best of the best.”</p>
<p>“But you dream of whores and unfaithful wives. This I do not understand?”</p>
<p><em>Santo</em> sat stiff, like before the Kings judge, head down and his eyes fixed to the floor.</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> leaned in close. “You should be dreaming of a beautiful young woman making diner or walking with you in the <em>piazza</em>. Pleasant things…pleasant things…unless.”</p>
<p><em>Santo</em> squinted his eyes when he looked at <em>Enzo</em>. “Unless what?” “The woman in the dream…your wife. Have you mistreated her?” “No. Never. My God, she is a fine woman.”</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> shakes his head.</p>
<p>“You left her, my friend.” He leaned to <em>Santo</em>, touching the side of his head. “In here you abandoned her. You said it to me. Back in <em>Sicilia</em>, I believe. It is not your wife, but your own guilt.”</p>
<p><em>Santo</em> stared meekly at the iron wall. “I did. I abandoned her.”</p>
<p>“When you think she is unfaithful…this is your punishment. It is clear to me.” <em>Santo</em> relaxed. “But this bitch…who is it…and why does she curse her?”</p>
<p>I could not hear <em>Enzo’s</em> answer, if he said anything, and I believed it was of no concern to me. I realize at that moment, <em>Enzo</em> was the strangest of men, made different from the rest of us by God; educated and soft, with hands like a woman, not fit for a hard day’s work in the field.</p>
<p>He spoke proudly of this, admitting these same facts about himself, in some later conversation we had over <em>grappa</em>. “The mind is everything, and it is nothing. The body is nothing, and it is everything.” I freely admit I did not understand this <em>contraddizione</em>, and still do not, after all these years. When he stepped from the shadows in <em>Napoli</em>, if I had said, “go away,” he would not be with us now. Is he running from some woman, maybe a wife? If he had a wife, he would have mentioned her by now. Or the law? I do not believe it. The rich, the educated, never cross the line. If they get near the line, the line is moved. <em>Enzo</em> admits to nothing, except he is a teacher, from <em>Roma</em> and <em>London</em>, where he molded the bastard sons of bastard fathers, into men of importance (but they were already born to it).</p>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">The American Dreamers and a Fateful Question</h3>

<p>The room was near empty and there was no trouble finding a place to sit, where we made small talk to pass the time. The family at the next table, a man, a wife and two female children, who were fine looking, clean and not haggard, from <em>Gela</em> in the south of <em>Sicilia</em>. I have heard of <em>Gela</em>, but I have not been there. From the name it sounded like a good place to live. The father, <em>Andrea</em>, I believe, was a farmer and in conversation he claimed this to be his third trip to America. His age, he thought, was about forty, but he was not sure, yet he looked younger and was fit. He spoke freely about his life, and I thought it strange for a man to be loose with the tongue, among strangers. He was a talkative man, more like a woman.</p>
<p>“At first,” he said, “I was like everyone else…maybe you men, too. Go to <em>l’america</em>…work hard…save money.” He put his right hand to his ear and rubbed his fingers furiously rubbed his fingers together. “<em>I soldi</em>,” he said, loudly and with feeling.</p>
<p>“Money? What else is important?” His wife was plain, but with a generous look, that she could do a good day’s work, and she gave her man a cold stare.</p>
<p>“And family?” she asked. “What about family?”</p>
<p>He turned to her, embarrassed, and bowed slightly at the waist, then smiled and agreed he was mistaken and went on with his story.</p>
<p>“When I have saved enough money, I will buy land. For my family, of course.” He looks at his wife and they both smile. He had worked the farms in America, someplace in New York (I forget the town) but the work was seasonal, and the money was poor, as he expected it would be.</p>
<p>“Why would they pay foreigners good money?” he said. “We are a dime a dozen,” like they say. When the weather turned bad, some of the foreigners, mostly <em>Siciliani</em>, went home to catch the end of the growing season, but for half pay if they were lucky. Some stayed in America, going south to work the sugar cane farms, but he heard they were treated like dirt by the landowners and the colored workers hated them, and carried knives and guns, and were dangerous people when they had a grievance.</p>
<p>“Not me,” he said, putting a finger to his chest. “I refused to go south and work for those bastards, so I went home, near broke. The men who stayed, a few, forgot their <em>Sicilian</em> families and made new ones in America.” He bowed his head and made the sign of the cross. “May God forgive them,” he said, quietly. His last time in <em>Sicilia</em> was the worst time. No work at all, and his wife and children lived with his father to survive.</p>
<p>“No more,” he said, his finger in the air. “We left <em>Sicilia</em>, and other men’s land.” <em>Enzo</em> asked a good question.</p>
<p>“How will you live if you cannot not farm?”</p>
<p>“I have been promised work in the mines of …of,” he stumbled over the words, “in <em>Penasoolvanea</em>... there is <em>molto carbone</em>(coal). Mountains of it. This is where we will go…<em>Penasoolvanea</em>. Steady work for any man not afraid to get dirty. In a few years, I will have enough money to buy my own land. They promised me, their hand to God.” He had a dream of being his own <em>capu</em>, and no man in his family had been a boss and he would be the first. A job, land, his own boss? I envied him and what he wanted to be. But I doubted him, all the same.</p>
<p>“And you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“We will work the steamroads,” I said, “Except <em>Enzo</em> here, who is a teacher.”</p>
<p>He shook his head and seemed to pity us. “No, my friends. Your life is not for me.” “You prefer coal mines to the railroad?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Certainly. Why not? I am a sane man. You will freeze your goddamned ass in the winter and boil in the summer…you will see.” He turned to his wife, “<em>scusa</em>,” he said, apologizing for the rough language, not fit for women to hear. <em>Enzo</em> cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“You would rather be hundreds of feet below the ground?”</p>
<p>The man stroked his cheek. “Rather be?” He thought. “No. But I will get used to it.” He excused himself and his family. “We are going to take a walk on deck,” he said.</p>
<p>What he said hit me like a glass of cold water in the face. We were surprised on the casual way he talked, as if it was nothing. Fresh air? Nothing? <em>Enzo</em> took his arm.</p>
<p>“You have been on deck?”</p>
<p>“No, not yet” he admitted, “Today is the day. My girls have forgotten the sweet smell of clean air, and I have promised them a stroll in the sun.” <em>Luca</em> takes <em>Andrea</em> by the arm.</p>
<p>“They do not want riffraff from steerage rubbing elbows with the <em>gentile</em> people.” “why not,” <em>Andrea</em> replied. “I have paid my money. We are entitled to our piece of the pie.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” <em>Luca</em> answered. “But never turn your back on these people. They will throw you and your family overboard for fun.” <em>Andrea</em> laughed.</p>
<p>“You exaggerate, but I thank you for your concern and wish you all <em>Buona Fortuna</em>, and he bowed, and his wife smiled and they took their children and left the room.</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> was taken by the man’s confidence. “<em>Buona fortuna</em> to you and your fine-looking family, but we have been told they do not want us associating with the better classes, so they have made up a story ab out using the deck for to store more cargo.”</p>
<p>“It is all bullshit, <em>Luca</em> yells, then apologized to the wife, who nodded and looked away. “You will need the God Himself and maybe His <em>Archangels</em> to walk this deck.”</p>
<p><em>Andrea</em> stared holes in <em>Enzo</em>. “God Himself? His <em>Archangels</em>? What do you mean...you talk foolishness?” His daughters each grabbed a hand and pulled him toward the door.</p>
<p>“The sun and the fresh air are God’s gift to us all of us, he said. “Why would we need permission to enjoy a gift from God?”</p>
<p>How innocent he was, and strange for a man his age. how strange for a man his age.</p>
<p>We said <em>ciao a tutti</em>, and how good it was to meet his family, that maybe we will meet again before America, but it was the last time we talked. I never knew if he had his walk in the sun with his two girls, like he promised. Years later, I hear a coal mine caved in, somewhere ‘<em>Penasoolvanea</em>.’ No one survived, they say, and it was just a feeling in my gut, but I remembered this man and knew he was dead in it. I prayed for his soul, though it was foolish, as I had no proof he was dead, or even there, in ‘<em>Penasoolvanea</em>.’ If I was wrong, and we should meet someday, I will ask him about his walk in the sun and was it worth it? All those years, crawling on your belly, harvesting another man’s mountain of coal, making him rich, hundreds of feet below the grass.</p>
<p>Was it all worth his dream of a little land?</p>
<p>His name? I thought <em>Andrea</em>. Maybe not, or I never asked, or if I did ask and he said it, I did not hear him, or I heard him wrong.</p>
<p>What was there to do for the rest of the day? Back to the cabin and sleep? What else? I looked to <em>Enzo</em> for more wisdom, that he gives freely.</p>
<p>“If I sleep another minute, I will never wake up again. We should find a place away from the confusion, maybe play few hands of <em>briscola</em> and talk…about America.” The card room was full, except for one lonely table at the back, in a corner. We sat; we tried to relax, but I could feel it, the tension, and the air seemed to flutter, and it was damp, like before a storm. Something was going to happen, not a catastrophe, maybe a small accident, or if it was a catastrophe, I prayed I would not be killed, or any of my friends.</p>
<p>I see the worst in everything, expect the worst and it usually happens.</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> says I was a <em>fatalista</em>. I did not know the word, but it was bad, he said and men who suffer this disease are unhappy, never successful in whatever we do.</p>
<p>I nod at the two men at the next table; I believe they were <em>Calabrese</em> from their dialect and the caps on their head. A <em>Calabrese</em> man always wears a cap, and I believe for this reason they are mostly bald men. There was a ruckus in the middle of the room, bad as I have seen; three men playing cards(gambling)came to blows. Quick, like they fell from the ceiling, two burley sailors, who would make good fighters for money, broke up the fight, but tempers were hot, and the sailors struggled to keep the peace. The burliest of the two and the meanest looking, ordered the gamblers to calm down. “No gambling, you sonofabitchs, for the rest of the trip…or else,” he bellowed, to wake the dead, as he pointed to each man, and they stood quietly, thinking out their next move. Always it was in the back of our heads, the threat, that troublemakers would be thrown off the boat, wherever we were at sea.</p>
<p>“He broke the rules,” they will tell the family, if the family asks. “We put him ashore, somewhere. The records are not clear.”</p>
<p>The big loser refused to give up or retreat and accused the second of cheating, and the third of helping him cheat. The fight took off again, right under the sailors’ nose, and the table overturned, and the chairs scattered about the middle of the room. The sailors ordered the mess cleaned up and the men be to be civilized, but no, they squared off and fought again. The big sailor, <em>apelike</em> (<em>Enzo’s</em> words) took hold of the loser and dragged him into the corner, and after a time, with the sailor’s face in the gamblers face, he settled down and agreed to obey. The fighters righted the tables and picked up the chairs, but the loser taunted, threatening the other two, demanding his money be returned, and in the end, the two sailors dragged him from the room. I see this loser before; in fact, I see him several times each day, but not once after he was put out of the room. Overboard? I cannot believe it. While these two sailors were tough, did they seem capable of such a vile act as murder? <em>Enzo</em>, like always, had an opinion.</p>
<p>“Too many eyes. They will be put off at the next port, <em>Cadiz</em>, I believe, but I doubt he will be thrown over the side…but maybe.”</p>
<p><em>Cadiz</em> is in <em>Spangna</em>, I learned.</p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, yes, of course,” I said, as if I had heard of this city before.</p>
<p>The two men at the next table scattered when the guards showed. They left a deck of old cards, worn and frayed at the edges, pictured with flowers, as I recall. I took the deck and dealt four hands of <em>briscula</em>. <em>Enzo</em> picked up the deal and arranged his hand, once, twice. “To hell with this,” he said and slid his cards across the table. “I am tired of games.” He was nervous today, jittery, and he played with the collar of his shirt, complaining it was tight, that he could barely breathe. When done fidgeting, he placed his hands on the table, like waiting for some great event to happen. My imagination? I gathered the cards and dealt again, but each time <em>Enzo</em> refused his hand. After the third deal <em>Luca</em> groaned, said he was tired and went back to the cabin. <em>Santo</em> stayed for another hand, then followed <em>Luca</em>.</p>
<p>Just me and <em>Enzo</em>.</p>
<p>I dealt a hand. “We play, just the two of us,” I said. He picked up his cards, shuffled them in his hand and looked at me.</p>
<p>“I have a sense there is something you want.” “A sense?” I ask. “What is that? A sense?”</p>
<p>“Like a feeling. And I have this feeling you are not sure of me.” At that, he paused and looked me in the eyes. “Are you? And what about your friends? What do they think of me?” I chose not to answer, and this angered him, and like a bad loser, he threw his cards in the middle of the table.</p>
<p>“Tell me, <em>Antonino</em>, what do you want to know? Ask me now.”</p>
<p>He was sarcastic, in a way, but his voice was weak and trembling, more like a man ready to surrender. I thought, by what right do I question this man? I am not family, and I am not the law or does he owe me money. What is my right? There was something in his voice that dared me, so I decided to ask, even if he did not tell the truth.</p>
<p>I relaxed and let out a long, loud breath.</p>
<p>“I wonder, and <em>Santo</em> and <em>Luca</em>, they also are wondering, why did you leave <em>Italia</em>?” <em>Enzo</em> nodded, that I should go on.</p>
<p>“We are <em>contadini</em>. We beg for work, but you, you are a teacher. We all know that educated men do not starve in <em>Italia</em>. You are going to a foreign country on a boat filled with men and women who have nowhere else to go. What is the sense of it?”</p>
<p>He shuffled in his seat and cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“So,” he paused. “You are thinking, what is the dark secret this man hides. Is that it?” I deal another hand and he smiles.</p>
<p>“Well, my friend,” he says, pausing to scratch his cheek, and the back of his neck. “The answer to this is, well, it is simple. You see, my brother has called for me…from America. I believe I said this to you before, or maybe it was <em>Luca</em>. My memory is not what it used to be.”</p>
<p>I nod, as we stare each other down.</p>
<p>“I recall said you were tired of teaching and this and that.” “I was no longer needed…as a teacher. That is all I meant.”</p>
<p>“Teachers are rare in <em>Italia</em>, and there are few in <em>Sicilia</em>. It is hard to believe you cannot find a decent job.”</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> wiped his on the sleeves of the ragged jacket he wore. He fumbled with a button on his collar, declaring he would buy a new shirt in America. He leaned forward in his chair and placed both hands on the tabletop, as if holding it down; he looked at me for a long while, and I knew there was something he had to say. He was tired and old looking, years older than his age. I saw a troubled man, and heard it in his voice when he talked, the trembling sound, the words that were forced from his mouth. Maybe he would confess to exciting things, or he was another <em>capu</em> on the run, like the old man, one step ahead of the law, or worse, the <em>brigands</em>.</p>
<p>“Is it the law?” I said, standing straight. “Are you running from the <em>Carabinieri</em>.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “No. I am sorry to disappoint you, but no one is looking for me. Who would waste time looking for an old man, a worn-out teacher of dead languages? No person of sound mind.”</p>
<p>“Then tell me, <em>Enzo</em>. Your secret? What is it?” There was a long and silent stare, but he blinked and broke and looked away, then swept his hand across the table, brushing away the crumbs for other men meals, and his cards fell onto the floor. Finally, he bowed his head. “I am ashamed to say this to another man…that I have disgraced myself and my family.” He said it quietly, like a penitent in the confessional, begging his priest for forgiveness.</p>
<p>“I am sorry to disappoint, but I am not running from the law, or thugs like the old man.” Then it was a woman, or a man who threatened him with revenge for…for…for whatever he did to her. “<em>Tu salute</em>,” I thought. “<em>Tu salute</em>.” But this was unlikely, as <em>Enzo</em> was, maybe twenty- five years older than me, and a fat man, in poor condition, with bad skin and a sore on his chin, that he picked, who has no energy and nearly fainted when we climbed two flights of stairs. He is too old to chase young women, too frightened to chase the married ones.</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> was sweating like a farm hand in the <em>August</em> sun.</p>
<p>I wanted to give him an honorable way out of this difficulty.</p>
<p>“It is not our goddamned business,” I said. “You owe us nothing, <em>Enzo</em>. I am worse than a nosey old woman for asking about your personal life.”</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair and took in a deep breath of air. “It is time I begin again,” he said. “And with my confession. You are correct. It is not your business, but I will tell you if you want to hear it, because I have learned to respect you men.” <em>Enzo</em> leaned forward, his elbows resting on the table, his head turned a bit away from me, and I thought, maybe he cannot look me in the eye.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” he said. “This is what I have done with my life. I have wasted all that time and have very little left.” He looked at his hands and began to twiddle his thumbs. I have never seen a man twiddle his thumbs. My grandmother twiddled her thumbs when she lost her mind, or I have seen old women, in the <em>piazza</em>, twiddling their thumbs. Not men.</p>
<p>“But as to you and your friends, <em>Santo</em> and <em>Luca</em>, I am thankful you befriended me and allowed me to share your trip. To be honest, I was afraid to travel alone, and when we met at the dock in <em>Napoli</em>, I was ready to give up and leave for some other place. Any place. You said I am an educated man, but that is only one part of me, the good part and I am proud of it, that I have earned it in my own way. But we are all like the moon, with a dark side and I have mine. You see, <em>Antonino</em>, I have a fatal flaw from which I may not recover. I am a gambler and worse, a bad gambler. I cannot recall the last time I won.”</p>
<p>He expected I would be shocked at what he said, but I have known gamblers before, in the army, and they did not seem a special kind of evil men. Most of them were, well, shabby and worthless, but not evil. I smiled and he turned a little white.</p>
<p>I told him, “Now I understand. You are running from men who you owe money to. The hell with them. They are all <em>vita bassa</em> and not to be taken seriously. Pretty harmless, I guess.”</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> agreed.</p>
<p>“Yes, gamblers are <em>vita bassa</em>, low life, and you are correct, most are harmless, but not all.” He stared at the floor. “And I accept I am <em>vita bassa</em>, too. I have fought it for years, but now I accept it.” He kept rubbing his hands together, then scratching at himself, his neck and cheek and forehead, and the sore on his chin, that on closer look, I saw was festering. “I am more than a gambler, though. I am a thief, a common thief and this is the root of my problem and, well, why I am here with you. I am also a common thief, no more, no less.” For the first time I notice his eyes were black and sunken, as if sentence his sentence had been pronounced and it was death.</p>
<p>He opened to me, his soul, and confessed his sins, and I was honored, but why me? What could I offer to ease his burden? Was I some priest?</p>
<p>“You? A thief? No. I cannot believe it. Not a man with your education and manner. You are making this up to make yourself seem…what is it...to make yourself seem more masculine, man of the world.” Then I thought, who would call himself a thief when he was not a thief? I was certain he had a good reason to steal, if he did.</p>
<p>“You stole what you needed to survive…like food. Correct, and not out of greed. This I can understand. You were you down on your luck? How is it a crime?” He lay his head on the table for a long time, and I could hear him talking, but not to me, and I figure he was praying. I would have worn out my knees, praying, if I were him. Finally, he raised himself straight in his chair, looked me in the eyes and sighed and breathed deep.</p>
<p>“To answer your question,” he paused, then licked his lips, “and it is an honest question. No. I was not starving.” He brushed his hand across the table, made a nervous fidget, and picked at the sore on his chin. At that moment, he was anything but a teacher, as I would guess they are all neat and clean and respectable, and his clothes were filthy and ragged, not even a good wash by a good woman could save them. Out of the blue, with no expression, he said this, plainly, “I stole from my students.” I stared, and immediately, I doubted what he said.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat. “For years, may God forgive me,” and he makes a perfect sign of the cross, “Gambling was a way of life for me, like some men play chess, or read, or watch the ocean. Now I am no better than a common roustabout. The last time I stole, it was from a student, and I was caught, like the fool I am, and the headmaster took joy in firing me, and blackballing me for the rest of my life.” He paused and brushed at his jacket.</p>
<p>“So now I am here, with you and your friends. God help you all.”</p>
<p>I was shocked, yes, but I believed I could still like this man, but I could not, in my head, believe that what he did was all right. It was not. And I was angry.</p>
<p>“You stole from children? Is that what you are saying?” He stared at the floor.</p>
<p>I could not put these words together with any sense. ‘Thief,’ and ‘steal,’ and ‘children.’ He moved his chair next to mine and leaned in close, his face inches away, and I felt his breath when he talked. I was too close to another man, and I pushed him back.</p>
<p>“This last boy was my <em>Waterloo</em>. His father was a great landowner from near <em>Napoli</em>; wealthy and powerful, unforgiving to men like me. These men send their sons to the great cities, where they associate with the best and are educated by the best of teachers. Their families do not countenance men who steal from their children, but it was not the devil who was my enemy, so much as boredom. There are just so many books to read and lectures to hear, and you spend too much time with yourself. I succumbed to the spell of Lady Luck. Gambling. I was captivated by her wiles, and the thrill of it, like nothing I have felt before. I had little money to bet, and usually I would lose it all. So, I…”</p>
<p>“You stole from children because you were bored? Is that what…”</p>
<p>Two men, younger than me, and tall, asked if they could they sit down, as there were not two other empty chairs in the room. I lied. “<em>Mi dispiaci</em>. I am sorry, but these chairs belong to our women when they return.” They accepted my lie (a harmless lie) and left with no fuss or complaint. <em>Enzo</em> said I should not have lied to the men, that we should have welcomed them or moved, then he apologized for ‘moralizing,’ that he had no right. The strain was showing on his grey face, the color of a corpse, but when I touched his arm, he roused a little and gave a weak smile.</p>
<p>“Did I steal because I was bored? No. Not that. Boredom had nothing to do with my vice. I drank most nights, at a bar near the school where I taught. There were, well, there were women employees, and they…” He stared off. “You understand what I mean. I believe you were in the army.”</p>
<p>I knew what he meant, but I was embarrassed to say I did.</p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>. Those women. I understand what you say.” He was speaking of prostitutes and whores, but I was too embarrassed to say what everyman knows.</p>
<p>“They were good looking women,” he said, with a faint smile. “Not beautiful, but fair as women go. And I admit, for a glass of decent wine and a few <em>lire</em>, well, they would sit and talk and sometimes they…well, you know. Have you been lonely?” He stared at me, waiting, his mouth open, and I realized he asked a question, expecting my answer.</p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, who has not been lonely?” He nodded and smiled, and I believe he was thinking back to her.</p>
<p>“There was this one special lady, <em>Leticia</em>, half my age and she could curse like a man. I found it seductive, uh, all of it, but in the end I God-damned her soul to hell.” He paused and cleared his throat. “I know it was evil, what I did, and I should not have done it, but she used her wiles and did me in. I was shamed me into a card game with four men, younger than me and better card players. I should have refused, but I would have seemed old and weak to this younger woman. I wanted to impress her so she would stay around, and, maybe, she would...” He took a deep breath.</p>
<p>A camp follower? I have seen them before, these camp followers, but not a beautiful camp follower, not even good looking, or attractive, but they all swore like soldiers and some men found it sweet and appealing, like some music, or good wine. I have not heard a woman curse in a long time; my grandmother, sometimes, but she is sick and dying.</p>
<p>“I was drunk,” he said, “Easily cheated. I lost more than I could pay. Her bastard friends threatened to break my legs with a rock, no matter how long it took, or how much I screamed. ‘Who will hear you in the woods?’ is what they said and laughed. ‘The trees?’</p>
<p>I was terrified, I could barely breath. ‘You have two days to pay,’ they said. ‘Or else.’ The big one, the mean one kept saying ‘or else,’ and I think he enjoyed saying it more than the prospect of money. ‘Or else.’ <em>Antonio Donato</em>, a student, a bad student I can honestly say, was the son of one of the richest men in <em>Italia</em>, and to this boy I gave the honor of saving me from broken legs and broken arms. Why him? He wore the best clothes, and boasted he carried a hundred <em>lire</em> in his coat pocket...five times what I earned in a month. I reasoned that his father, <em>Carmine Donato</em>, because he was rich, was a thief himself, so I would only be stealing stolen money. What is that next to broken legs? My broken legs.”</p>
<p>“Then you robbed a young boy?” I ask. He was annoyed the way I put the question, and he pushed his chair from the table and half stood up.</p>
<p>“Robbery?” He stepped away from the table. “My God, no. What do you think I am? Robbery is a crime of violence. There was no violence. Am I a violent man? A theft. A petty theft, that’s all it was. I swear.”</p>
<p>I told him, sit down, relax.</p>
<p>“A petty theft, that’s all,” he kept repeating.</p>
<p>Was his crime so bad? After all, as he plead in his excuse, the boy’s father was rich and probably stole what he had from other people. I felt better, for a while, but as I thought more of it, I realized he probably caused the boy’s father to steal more, to replace what he had lost, but <em>Enzo</em> seemed at peace with the whole thing. ‘The Lord loves educated men,’ he often said.</p>
<p>“My plan was simple. I surprised my students with an examination on <em>Latin</em> verbs. Even the best student would need a full hour to finish. They complained when I announced the test, but I reminded them ‘from <em>adversity</em> comes success.’”</p>
<p>“<em>Adversity</em>?”</p>
<p>“Yes, <em>adversity</em>. It means, uh, something like pain and suffering.”</p>
<p>I nodded and he smiled. “<em>Si</em>, I understand, now that you have explained it so well,” and he smiled again.</p>
<p>“Yes. You learn fast, <em>Antonino</em>. And to make it easy, I invoked the honor system, reminding them of severe penalties for cheating, and then I left the room.”</p>
<p>I laughed. “You put them on the honor system?”</p>
<p>“It sounds, well, foolish, I know, but I was desperate. Remember. Broken legs! These boys are spoiled, too rich, and we all know the rich have no character or work ethic. I was helping him. In a sense doing him a favor by stealing from him and his father. They threw their money in my face; the same as pissing on me, and I was their teacher and entitled to respect. It is wrong they dressed better than I could, with folding money in their pockets and respect. This is all I will say on that.”</p>
<p>The two men who asked to sit at our table, returned, and it was clear from their manner they no longer believed our story, as two chairs were still empty. No women. I needed a better lie. I spoke softly as I looked around the room. “My wife…she has problems. You understand. Problems only women have. She came back for a few minutes, but she was sick again and left.” I pointed to <em>Enzo</em>, who said nothing, but looked innocent. “His wife is with my wife, caring for her. When she returns, I cannot guarantee she will not be sick again. She will need to sit.”</p>
<p>Yes, of course they understood the special problem women have, as they were both married men. They apologized for bothering us and wandered away. <em>Enzo</em> continued his story. .</p>
<p>“This rich little bastard, <em>Donato</em>, always hung his jacket on the same hook outside my classroom. If another boy hung his jacket on <em>Donato’s</em> hook, it would end up on the floor. He was a mean little bastard, like his father, who always backed his son with <em>lire</em>. The day I called for the quick examination, I reached into the boy’s jacket and removed his pouch, filled with about two hundred <em>lire</em>, neatly folded. I took it all, the money and the pouch, as the pouch was made of fancy leather that would bring a decent price on the street. Maybe twenty <em>lire</em> (a month’s pay). I sweated like a pig, like I am sweating now, and the wallet nearly slipped from my hands onto the floor.”</p>
<p>He took a rag off the table and wiped his forehead and the back of his neck, then folded it and smoothed it and placed it back in the same spot. Neat and civilized, of course.</p>
<p>“But goddamn his soul to hell, the janitor, a man who does nothing more than sweep the floor, saw everything.” <em>Enzo</em> laughed, as he leaned to me.</p>
<p>“<em>Antonino</em>, do you see the <em>Ironia</em>?”</p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, the <em>Ironia</em>? Maybe. I am not sure.”</p>
<p><em>Enzo</em> nodded. “Good. At least I may have taught you something. I returned to my class, the pouch in my pocket. A few minutes later the headmaster came into my room, but he did not knock, as was the custom at that school, and demanded I return the pouch, not even asking if I was innocent. In front of my class, he took the word of a janitor. An illiterate <em>cavone</em> who…” <em>Enzo</em> caught himself. “<em>Scusa</em>,” he said. “<em>Mi dispiace</em>, but I am upset all over again.”</p>
<p>“<em>Si</em>, <em>si</em>, go on. What happened with the headmaster?”</p>
<p>“I knew my word would count little against the son of a wealthy man; I refused to protest or argue, to belittle myself. In the end, you must believe this, I was too honest to lie. Another <em>Ironia</em>?”</p>
<p>This word he used, ‘<em>ironia</em>,’ was not a word I knew, but from what he said about his ordeal, I am proud to say I figured it out. I believed I understood its meaning. But no, I did not see the <em>ironia</em>.</p>
<p>“Did they call the cops?”</p>
<p>“If you mean the <em>Carabinieri</em>, no, they were not called, thank God. The headmaster did not want it known there was a thief in his employ, who taught the sons of the rich and powerful in <em>Roma</em>. I was escorted down the hall, like a common criminal, as I loudly protested, reminding the headmaster he did not knock before entering my classroom, as it was the custom, as a show of respect. What angered me the most, when I walked past the janitor, the man who informed was holding a broom and he walked next to me for a way, taunting me and smiling. <em>Buonjiorno</em>, <em>professore</em>. How is your day so far?” I thought about kicking him, or punching him in the face, but I still held a thread of hope I could talk my way out of this dilemma. But no. Within the hour I was thrown into the street, and I was refused the pay I had already earned for the month I taught. The excuse was that I had disgraced the school and my calling. I had three <em>lire</em> to my name and my rent was due in two days. I heard the headmaster pocketed my wages, and bought wine and whores for himself, but at a better place in a getter part of <em>Roma</em>.”</p>
<p>“How did you survive?” I ask,</p>
<p>“My cousin took me in. I lived in his shed, like a beggar, not one of his family. He was ashamed of me, but never said it. I was to be pitied, that is why he helped me. Money for my passage came out of his pocket, only because he wanted to be rid of me.”</p>
<p>“Did you look for work at another school,” I said, as it would seem reasonable to do so. “No, no,” he shook his head, furiously. “The headmaster would never say I was a thief, but discharged for poor teaching skills, and who would hire me? What was the use? The headmasters will shun me like a skunk with its tail raised. No decent school in <em>Italia</em> will ever hire me, and I will not work at the religious establishments –<em>Catholic</em> schools- because I am a well know <em>agnostic</em>. You see, my friend, I have no teaching career left, at least not in <em>Italia</em>. I am like you, as you say you have no future here. This is why I am going to America.”</p>
<p>The poor bastard looked gray, sick and I cannot remember when I have seen a man look worse and still be alive. I wondered, had he been truthful with me, or what else has he hidden away, and I wondered if we should have taken him along, or let him stay.</p>
<p>“Soon you will be with your brother and his is family,” I said only to calm him.</p>
<p>“Well, yes. My brother is somewhere in America. I have heard from men who knew him, but we have not seen each other or written for many years. I will find him, though, if he is still alive.”</p>
<p>Once he had confessed, everything else came easy. He enjoyed women, he said, mostly loose women, foul mouthed women (who cursed like men). But for all his faults, he may have been the most honest man I ever knew. An honest thief? Is this “<em>ironia</em>?” Why did he choose me as his confessor, a man he barely knew, and did not expect to see again? Maybe that was his reason. <em>Papa</em> might say, after some thought, that <em>Enzo</em> a good man, but a weak man, only honest when it suited him, and putting him above most men I have known.</p>
<p>“It will be difficult to find my brother in America. I have read it is <em>grande molto</em>, stretching from one ocean to another. But what choice do I have? There is nothing left for me here. I am marked, much like this old <em>capu</em>.” He took a rag from his pocket and wiped his eyes and ears. “I am <em>Siclianu</em>, by birth. Did you know it? Born in <em>Salice</em>, a few miles from where you were born. Our paths have crossed for what reason, and some would say it was <em>Fate</em>.” <em>Enzo</em> coughed, then coughed again and apologized. He was not feeling well, he said. The bad air was his excuse. “I wager you thought I was from <em>Roma</em> or <em>Milano</em>, or some other grand town. Maybe <em>Genova</em> or <em>Pisa</em>, where all the scholars live? My mother and father, God rest their souls,” he made the sign, “Were peasants, like you and your family. For them to see me this way. Well, I am glad they are dead.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever worked a farm, or worked with your hands?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, and like a dog, so I understand what it is like to work until you drop. I shared a pen with the rest of the animals. One night I ached so bad I could not sleep. I stared at the ceiling, and it came to me, the futility of my life. I packed what I had into a knapsack and left. My oldest brother, we are the only survivors, I have not seen in many years.” He cleared his throat. “But I repeat myself. I went to <em>Napoli</em>, then <em>Roma</em> and <em>Venezia</em>, taught myself to read and write, studied the <em>classics</em>. But my career did not prosper until I presented my degree in letters from the University, in <em>Pisa</em>. A prestigious school.” “<em>Pisa</em>? It is in the north of <em>Italia</em>?”</p>
<p>“It is north of <em>Roma</em>, but south of <em>Genova</em>. The weather is fine and temperate.” “Your family would be proud you studied in a fine school. <em>Molto Orgoglioso</em>, very proud.”</p>
<p>He looked at me in that way men look when they are thinking, “you are a fucking fool.” He shook his head, no. “You see, I have never said this to another man, my degree is…well, to be honest, a forgery. Completely worthless. <em>Indegno</em>. Of no value, except to fool other fools and pompous men.” He excused himself. “I do not mean you or your friends.” I was certain he did, but I accepted he was different, in a way superior for all his faults.</p>
<p>“I bought my degree in a bar, from a master forger, down on his luck, who could fool <em>St. Peter</em> on a bad day. I duped everyone, even the asses who run great universities. But it was not just the fake degree. I was convincing. I had real knowledge from books. I was never questioned or asked to prove my degrees validity, thank God. But now that my career in <em>Italia</em> is finished, and I have been branded a fraud and a thief, I call myself what I am. A failure. What worse could happen to a man, but to foresee his own death?” He paused. “All because a piss of a janitor could not mind his business.”</p>
<p>“You have papers from a great university. What will they know in America?”</p>
<p>“No degree. Gone. Lost in a card game, to a <em>cavone</em> who can barely speaks his own language. He wanted it to brag to his friends. I believe he cheated me. I will never know the truth.”</p>
<p>My thought, as this was the first confession I ever heard, what would <em>Patri Carmine</em> say? Did I listen well, and nod and make sounds at the right times? My penance for him was three <em>Hail Mary’s</em>, three <em>Our Fathers</em> and a good <em>Act of Contrition</em>. It was about right, I thought. I reached to him and touched his shoulder as I see he was distressed; he began to cry, quietly at first, then sobbed like a woman and I was embarrassed for him, as I knew others would see him and not understand. Men should not cry, no matter the pain. Women may cry, it is their right as women, but men, never. I have seen men cry, and I am embarrassed for them. I have wept in my life, but never in front of another man, or anywhere they might see me cry. I would rather die, and this, I realize, is an easy thing to say. <em>Enzo</em>, his face red and swollen, at first refused to leave the table, until I said we were being watched by strangers. I left and he followed, walking in my shadow through the confusion of all the hallways and passages. We found our room half empty, as many were in the card room, or standing in the halls like dead men, propped against the wall until ordered to move on. Four men were playing cards, kneeling at a table made from a rough- cut board, set across two empty pails. They were young men, but acting like old card players, joking on each hand and laughing if one made a foolish play. The <em>capu</em> was in his bed, laying still as if asleep, or maybe he was. Strange he was there, as he usually left in the morning and returned late at night. His breathing was light, so he was still alive; being dead, then, and lying somewhere else, was not a possibility. I was relieved to see him breathe, as the thought of being in a room with a dead man upset me like nothing else.</p>
<p>“To hell with him,” I thought, then <em>Patri Carmine</em> whispered, “He is God’s child.” <em>Patri</em> was there, a, all the time. I was never free of him. He was sometimes like a curse.</p>
<p>We took to our blankets(beds) and after a while <em>Enzo</em> struggled to stand and he stretched, and I hear the joints crack in his body.</p>
<p>“So painful to be an old man,” he said. “I should sleep in the toilet, so my noises do not keep you awake.”</p>
