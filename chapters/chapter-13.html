<div class="chapter-body">


<p class="calibre4">I have no good memories of Calabria. I was forced to be here, against my will when I was drafted to soldier in the Kings Army. Who asked me if I wanted to be here?  No one asked. The people in Calabria, and I swear an oath to this, are rude and loud by nature, and hold the Siciliani in low regard, though it is well known we are the superior people.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">They say, these Calabrese, “everything is better in Calabria.” The food, the wine, all better, and the women more beautiful than anywhere in Italia. And <i class="calibre5">Virtuoso</i>(virtuous). I know better. The puttanu who followed the army are Calabrese women, who did not hear that all Calabrese women are <i class="calibre5">virtuoso. </i>The food is foul, with no flavor, like wet paper, and their wine is harsh and sour and whole barrels spoil overnight. Signuri *<i class="calibre5">Cosimo Rinaldi</i>, a Siciliani who married a Calabrese woman of some means, owned a farm near the camp where I trained, when not guarding piles of wood and wagons with no wheels, I worked for him and what he paid I kept, sending my army pay home; it helped, papa said, although a few times it was lost, or stolen in the mail; mostly stolen. Never give mail to an officer, as he is likely to lose it, or steal it.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">When my time in Calabria was near over, Rinaldi came to see me in the field. “Stay,” he said. “Marry my daughter, *Giuseppina is in need of a husband.” Why me? He respected me. I knew how to sweat, he said, and any man who ‘sweated’ like I ‘sweated’ would always support a wife and children, and relatives (him and his wife) in their old age. “You honor me,” I said, “but…” and at ‘but’ he took my arm, and we walked the farm he promised would be mine when he passed. I was so afraid his offer would trap me there, I stuttered like a fool. “Your daughter, Giuseppina, she is too women for me,” I said, meaning she was twice too much, not slim, like a woman should be. He believed I had complimented his daughter, that she was someone too good for me; he thanked me, saying he understood, but should I change my mind, his offer was open unless he found a better man for his daughter. I stopped to see him the day I left, to thank him for the work and hospitality. He gave me tomatoes, and other vegetables for my trip, and wine for my father, in a green bottle made in Napoli. When papa took his first taste, he laughed and poured the rest in a ditch, saying, “Like piss from a Calabrese cesspool, but I like the green bottle,” and he kept it on the windowsill, and bragged to his friends how it came from Napoli.  </p>
<p id="page_412" class="calibre7">**** </p>
<p class="calibre6">There were seven of us. Me, Luca and Santo, and the four D’Arrico’s. </p>
<p class="calibre6">We walked toward the piazza where we could get help to the train, only following Patri Amita’s advice.  We come on a weathered old man leaning against a cart, smoking a foul cigar, and staring at the sky, like a fool. He greeted us, claiming to be a skilled tradesman, and for a small price, or whatever we wanted to give, he would sharpen our knives and axes, anything that needed a fine edge. He had no horse or mule, but a small cart he pulled, and when I asked he complained that hauling a grinding wheel over rough cobblestone, “all these years,” was torture for a man his age; seventy-five, <i class="calibre5">settanta cinque</i>, and his bones and muscles ached day and night for it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is it worth all this pain just to be alive,” he said </p>
<p class="calibre6">He looked at Amaria with lust, this old man.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, this beauty is going to America?” She blushed and looked away.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, America,” I answered, “all of us.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then you are looking for the train?” He spit tobacco juice at the cobblestone, some  splashing on my boot, and he looked at me and wiped his mouth.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Scusa,” he said, “I am an old man, with poor aim.”       </p>
<p id="page_413" class="calibre6">I kneeled and wiped my boot. I looked up to ask a question, but the sun was in my eyes, and I looked away. “What about the train?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">This time he spits into the weeds. “Then you are going to Napoli?”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, Signuri, Napoli.  All of us. But we need the train.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiace</i>. I am sorry for your boots,” he apologized again. “Come home with me, it’s near here,” he said, pointing down the street. “My wife will clean your boots, like new. No charge.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He embarrassed me, “No, grazie, it is not necessary. The train to Napoli?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He took my arm. “You have knives to sharpen?” he asked, pulling me to the back of his small cart.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Fifty years’ experience.” He waved his hand across the horizon. “They know me all over the province. I work cheap and I work fast and mind my own business.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, I am sure you are the best, but …” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He took a honing stone from a leather pouch, and ran a small knife across it, two or three times. “This knife here has a fine edge, and small, right for women when they cut vegetables.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo, who I see was impatient, came to the back of the cart.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why are we wasting time?” he asked, honestly. “The train? We need to find the train.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh, you want train,” the old man replied.  “You hould have said it. Or did you say it. Do I look like a mind reader to you?” He points over my shoulder, “Go three more blocks to Via Capone. Turn right.” He removed his cap and wiped the brim.  “No, no…maybe you should turn left? I get confused when the sun is in my eyes…anyway, you will see them when you get there. Go another few hundred feet to Piazza Monti…no, Piazza Riale. Look for the wagons and pick a good man. Pick an idle man as he needs the work and will give you a good price. I am *Giuseppe Laconi,” he said, bowing at the waist. “Use my name. They all know me.”  He held a honing stone in the air and turned it in the sun and gazed at it. “A thing of perfection,” he said. “I sharpen dull knives to a keen edge. Do you have dull knives, or any knives at all?”  </p>
<p id="page_414" class="calibre6">“No, thank you signuri,” I said, “we will be on our way.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He kicked the wheel, and the cart almost shook apart. “If I had a god damn mule, I would be all over this province. Like thirty years ago. Then I was respected, not like….”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazie, Signuri,” I said. “We are grateful for your help.” We could not leave this unfortunate bastard fast enough. Before ten steps, “stop,” he screamed, and he shuffled to us.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Watch for those bastard <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> if you travel to Napoli...and the worst of all these bastards…what’s his name…let me think.” He scratched at the back of his head.  “*Andrea, that’s his name. Si, Andrea. You may hear he has been captured, but I doubt it. A man, cunning like a cat, with a thousand disguises. Today he is small, like a mouse, and tomorrow he is tall, bigger than a building. He has hair, he has no hair.  He walks, or he rides a grey mare, or runs with mules and a wagon. But he is a thief and a murderer, a defiler of women. They say he enjoys defiling women the most…more than murder.” He nodded to Amaria. “<i class="calibre5">Scusami</i>,” he said, slightly bowing his head. “I am not used to the company of women. It was the animal in me.” His face twitched too much, and I thought, another crazy bastard, who talks shit to hear his own voice. Amaria, who listened to his every word, asked him, “What are they doing to catch this man? You called him Andrea?” The old man smiled as he looked her over, as if she was a woman for sale. He raised him voice and became emotional, like a politician.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The law does nothing but collect taxes…the law does not work in this country…we are on our own.” He looks over Amaria, and her daughter, Agatina, and Emil pulled them back, away from the old man.     </p>
<p id="page_415" class="calibre6">“Women are drawn to Andrea,” he says, with a dirty laugh. “Like ants to a honey pot; I have heard he enjoys them all,” and he smiled dirty. He was an old fool, no less, and his mind was wicked and foul, and if they were my women, I would have beat him, berated him, at least, for what he said. Amaria stepped away from her husband and walked toward the old man, but Emil grabbed her arm.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Be still and walk away from here,” he said to her, more an order the way he said it.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You allow this man to…?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He is crazy. Look at him.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">She protested to the old man, ignoring her husband’s order to be silent.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are children in danger…or are you a crazy old fool?” This angered Emil, I believe, for this reason, that she showed him disrespect in front of other men.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Take the children and start walking,” he said. “I will worry about this Andrea.” Her eyes seemed to pop from her head, and her upper lip curled, and she talked under her breath, curses or words close to curses, but I cannot swear to it. In the end, she obeyed and walked away.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She is upset,” he said to me. “The woman who fell, the children. She will be all right once we get on the boat. Then it will be real.” I looked over my shoulder after we walked a block, only to see the old man working his grinding wheel and talking to himself. His lips were moving, is all I can honestly say. We come on the piazza, after two bad turns, and not a wagon was there, but idle men, drunk and loud. In the middle of the square, a pipe poured water into a round pool lined with rough stone. Three women, tired and haggard, stood in line at the fountain, behind an old man and his mule, and the women stared ahead, each holding a wooden water pail. The mule drank water as it came out of the pipe and the women fumed at the old man, who held hard onto the reins of this shaggy mule. The first women scolded him, that he allowed a mule to drink water meant for people. He ignored her. She threatened to call the law. She nodded to me, pleasantly, as I passed by to the end of the line, and all three women stared at my quiver of vines. It was a clean pool, good looking, well kept, and no floating garbage to speak of. Some bad smells, meaning, maybe, it was not always safe to drink. “If it’s good enough for a mule…” papa always said. The old man ties his animal it to a bench and watched as it ate weeds from between the cobblestones, happy and contented, with its feast. When it came my turn, I soaked the shoots in the cool water, as the old man stood off, whistling, waiting for me to finish.          </p>
<p id="page_416" class="calibre6">“Bongiornu, Signuri,” he said, in a weak voice, not masculine.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Bongiornu,” I answered, out of courtesy, but hoping he would leave me alone.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are not Calabrese, are you?” he said and laughed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. Siciliani, all of us.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ah,” he laughed again. “The other side of the world. And why are you in Calabria?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca rested on a bench, shielding his eyes from the sun with his two giant hands. Santo was deep in the bushes, his back to us and busy with needed things. Emil and his family sat at a small table with no cloth, while Amaria fed them bread and cheese. Cheese? I was offered bread on the ferry, but no cheese. If she offered me cheese, I would not have taken it, but I should have been asked.  Their children needed cheese, not me.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man coughed so I would look his way. “Are you looking for the train to Napoli?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, Napoli. We hear the line has been destroyed by flooding.” I waited. “Is it true?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. It is,” and he began to question me, like a nosey carabinieri.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Where did you get the vines?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Did you steal them?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Are you going to America?  </p>
<p id="page_417" class="calibre6">Who is the beautiful woman?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">My grandfather’s vineyard.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">No. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Yes, America, all of us.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">About Amaria, I lied, pointing to Luca. “She is his wife. The man on the bench, but he is crazy, and hears everything you say.” The old man coughed and stepped back.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Violent?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, violent. He has killed a priest, they say, but show him the train to Napoli and I will make sure he does not kill <i class="calibre5">you</i>. I am sure I can do it.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man was relieved. He probably thought of himself a lucky man, if all he got was a good beating for inquiring about another man’s wife.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mondialla</i> is the station you need,” he says. “But the tracks…they are gone much of the way.”  He used the heel of his boot to make marks in the soft dirt. “These stations were here, but now, curse the devil, they are gone.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He started telling me the story of his life, the wrong roads taken, and the mishaps he suffered along the way; why his wife left in the middle of the night, and the bastards who cheated him out of money and position; all his abusers and taunters; landlords, tax collectors and greedy men. “Baldini is my name,” and he said it again. He is forced to live off the charity of his brother; a great humiliation.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, si, I understand. You are Baldini. Your life is hell…but who can take us to <i class="calibre5">Mondialla</i>?” Baldini pulled at the old mule, that refused to move and Baldini cursed it.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why are you late?” he asked me, annoyed. “The others are at <i class="calibre5">Mondialla</i> by now.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was sorry we stopped to help a suffering human being.  </p>
<p id="page_418" class="calibre6">“Signuri, to be honest, we stopped and helped a woman from the ferry, who broke her ankle, bad, when she fell on the plank. She was near death, so we stayed.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">When he turned his head, his cap slipped to the side, but his eyes looked through me. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, you are the fools who helped the stranger? I heard it, and all the men here heard it. You wasted your time helping a stranger?” He spits on the ground and shook his head, at the same time pulling at the reins when his mule bucked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, she was a stranger,” I said, “But we did not stop for long. It was no trouble, as we turned her over to a priest, and he was kind enough to give directions to the train. ‘Use my name,’ he said, ‘one of the men will take you to the train.’” Baldini turned and spit, hitting the rush of water as it came out of the pipe: he looked around for the old women, but they were gone, thank God. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You did a foolish thing, Signuri, stopping for a stranger. Now you are alone. All the wagons are gone.”  He pointed North. “Gone,” he said again.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil walked to where we stood and put his hand on my shoulder. “What did you find out?” he asked. I shrugged.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Nothing,” I peeked at the old man from the corner of my eye.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How far is it to <i class="calibre5">Mondialla</i>?” I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Six, maybe seven miles…and let me be sure of this…she was not family?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“There must be a way,” Emil said. The old man stared.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You helped a woman who was not family?” he asked again. “Why would you do such a foolish thing?  If she was not family…she was no one.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil grabs the old man by the arm, but gently, not the fighting kind of grab. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My wife is a fine and caring woman,” he tells the old man. “I make no apologies for her. </p>
<p id="page_419" class="calibre4">I am proud she lives her faith in God. Not like so many who only talk about the right thing to do.” He paused and wiped his forehead. “I would have it no other way.”  I introduced Emil to the old man, Baldini, but they did not shake, as the old man hid both hands in his pockets, or did they exchange any other pleasant words.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where is she now?” Baldini asked. “This injured woman who was a stranger?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“With the sisters of Charity,” and he made the sign of the cross. “Patri Amita helped us. Do you know him?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Patri Amita?” Baldini took a half-smoked stogie from his shirt pocket. “The good father helped you?” Baldini smiled. “Did he extract from you a donation for the Church, or maybe for the poor?” Emil stepped back and looked over his shoulder to make sure Amaria was not close enough to hear, then he took the old man by the arm, and walked him ( and his mule) to the edge of the Piazza.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sixty lire,” Emil said.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini choked on his cigar. “Sixty lire? Mio Dio, you paid a fortune.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, sixty lire, most of our money. My wife would not leave. What could I do?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sixty lire?” Baldini repeated the number and laughed. “He saw you Siciliani getting off the boat,” and he laughed again. “He licked his lips when he saw you…a stranger, you say?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil moved between Baldini and the place where Amaria sat at the table.  “Keep your voice down. My wife can never know I paid off the priest.”  Baldini nods, insisting he understood women, like no other man. He was married, until she left with his money and his dignity. Speaking in a whisper, holding a single finger to his mouth. “Sixty lire is a fortune for a peasant.”  </p>
<p id="page_420" class="calibre6">“Si. It is a fortune. Near all we saved and the money from selling out. But our tickets are paid for, and they will feed us, thank God, and my brother will meet us at the dock. We will be alright. Si, we will be alright.” Baldini laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You should have jewed him down.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I tried, but the bast…,” he stops and did not finish the word. He cleared his throat.  “He wanted a hundred lire, and when I said no, he started to walk away until I showed him sixty, and he grabbed it.” Baldini laughed again, harder and longer. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My apologies, signori, for laughing, but this Amita, he put one over on you.  Everyone knows he is a gambler and a lecherous man who has fucked half the women in the parish. He would have done it for ten lire, I am certain of this.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ten lire? You think he cheated me? You say I am the fool?” Baldini pulled on the reins, holding his old, restless mule in place. Likely it was tired of eating weeds and drinking water.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You can only cheat an honest man,” Baldini said. “Amita is the best at what he does.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil decided to tell his wife where they stood, as she was upset, blaming herself for putting a stranger before her family. She asked Emil’s forgiveness, if he could. Agatina kissed her mother gently on the check, and they hugged, but the child was a remembrance of what she had done, and Amaria cried. Emil tried to console her; she coughed and wiped her eyes.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Bring us home,” she said, quietly. “It is the only thing we can do.”         </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil took her hand, rubbing it gently. “But our home in Sicilia is gone,” He pointed through a thick stand of trees, swearing to his wife it was the way to America. He was pointing north to the mountains, not America. I said nothing. Who am I to say anything?     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca protested in private, that he would not travel another mile with the D’Arrico’s hung around his neck, like a grinding wheel. “We stayed like the fools we are.  And look at us now.” Luca was right, goddamn him; men who came off the boat from Lipari walked by without a second look, and now they are in Napoli, drinking wine and playing cards, waiting for their boat to leave for somewhere else.  Probably a better place.   </p>
<p id="page_421" class="calibre6">Luca stared at Amaria sitting peacefully with her children; he sighed and shook his head.   “<i class="calibre5">Come bella</i>,” he said.  “But I understand why she did it, everything. It is part of her beauty.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6"> I told Luca I could not leave them alone. “You and Santo, go on your own. No hard feelings,” and I put out my hand, expecting him to leave. He smiled, said he would stay and protect me from the charms of any woman I will meet along the way.  And for some reason I do not understand, he added “Your Carmela is too good for you.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I said nothing but wondered if he was right.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini tapped my shoulder, itself annoying and I pushed him away, but he returned in a few minutes, muttering something about taking us to Mondialla.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Papa says, ‘It is only a crazy man that trusts another crazy man.’  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini patted his mule on the ass. “I know this animal does not look like much, but it pulls like a draft horse, but longer and farther and it will handle the weight without complaint…this I promise you men.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you have a wagon?” I asked. He swore he did, and it was a decent wagon.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He pointed down Via Capone “Only a way from here and I can hook up and be back in an hour.” He said like on the sly, looking at me from the corner of his eye, as he rubbed his chin.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But of course, uh, there is a small…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How much?” I asked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not much, I promise,” he said as he counted heads, figuring the number on the fingers on both hands. He finished his count, “let me think,” he says, scratching at the back of his neck.   </p>
<p id="page_422" class="calibre6">“Trust me, friend. I swear I am not a thief, like Amita. Be glad of it. I am neither a thief, a gambler or a lecher...or a priest. So, you are safe with me.” Amaria, who stood no more than three feet away, heard what Baldini said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Thief? What does he mean thief?” she asked Emil. “Who is a thief? Did he say Patri Amita is a thief?” Emil shrugged the question away. “I was not listening,” he said, and we began to talk of other things. She asked Baldini, “repeat what you said, signuri,” but he never answered, as he was counting heads, again, figuring on the fingers on both hands. Emil made an excuse to his wife, that Baldini was an old man, a fool, and who would pay him mind? But we need Mondialla, and this Baldini has offered to bring us to the train, and for this she was happy and gathered her children, asking no more questions about Amita.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini breathed deep and looked me in the eye.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Three lire each,” he said, holding up as many fingers on his right hand, “and one each for the children, since they take up less space.”  He checked faces, for a sign his prices were fair and decent, as far as we were concerned. They were not, I said, and Luca agreed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini recounted in his head.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, my friends, my price is more than fair, and less than this trip is worth, but since you stopped to save a helpless stranger, I will take two lire each and both children go for one.”  He watched our faces, seeing nothing he could use. “Free, no, they go free,” he said, “in honor of our patron,*Santo Rocco.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You can take seven people?” I ask, doubting he had a wagon of such size. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Seven? No. Eight, with me. Si. I have another mule, younger and stronger.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca shooed Baldini away, that we could discuss his offer, but he wandered closer the longer we argued, so we took two steps away, for every step he took closer. Emil made this point, and we agreed, that Baldini was crazy, but our last chance to catch the train. Emil apologized, saying there will be no hard feelings on his part if we went on alone. The only complaint was money. Like always. Luca wanted to bargain.    </p>
<p id="page_423" class="calibre6">“Four lire for the lot of us,” he said. “Take it or leave.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini laughed and said, loudly, “I leave it.” We haggled more; he was no easy man, or reasonable, agreeing on six lire in all, declaring it was a good deal, as it barely paid his expenses. “Wear on the wagons and mules. And me,” he points to himself. ‘What about me? Should I work for nothing? Is my labor worth shit?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca made an offer. “Only five lire and you will be overpaid.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">In the end, after whining and begging on Baldini’s part, we settled on six lire. I collect the money, counted it twice and readied to pass it to Baldini; he smiled and rubbed his calloused hands and reached for the cash. Luca grabbed Baldini’s wrist. “Not yet,” he said. “When we see the wagon and another mule…a good mule…you see three lire. Half the money.” Baldini pulled his wrist free from Luca’s grip, protesting that he was an honest man, ask anyone. “And when we see the train, you see the rest of the money.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini was insulted, he said, as he stepped back, his hands stirring the air. “No, signuri. All or nothing. Baldini is a dependable man. Ask anyone in Calabria.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca, who towered over Baldini, plain stared him down. “If we give you all the money, why should you come back? What do we know about you, except what you say? But we are desperate, and the mules do all the work, and you make all the money. You cannot lose unless we kill you in the end.” I figured Baldini would run for his life, but he only scratched his chin and started walking in a small circle, sweating like a hog in the August sun.  </p>
<p id="page_424" class="calibre6">“Well, you did help that poor woman,” he said, as he tipped his cap. “Si, I admire you all. You are an inspiration to all Calabrians.” He paused. “And the Siciliani, too. I will take half when I return with the mule and wagon.” So Baldini, with Luca at his side to see he returned, took a path through the woods near the piazza, and disappeared. We rested on the benches, while Santo held the reins of the mule left behind. We waited. They returned in less than an hour, the old man driving a wagon, pulled by a good-looking mule, young, not haggard, or beaten down, like the sickly sonofabitch he left behind. The wagon was a four-wheeler, to my surprise, but Luca said the front axle was worn and he feared we might lose a wheel.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini laughed. “It has wobbled for years,” and we accepted his excuse and let it go. Why? Desperate. We were desperate. Luca hands Baldini his down payment, half, not a cent more, as we agreed.  He counted the coins with such enthusiasm, one, two, three, I wondered, has he ever seen money before?  Baldini tells Luca, “Hitch the old mule to the wagon,” as his fingers and hands ached, since the weather turned cold, but otherwise, this was a good day for him. The old mule hitched easy, as if trained to hitch itself.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Andiamo, we go,” he said, and seven weary people climbed onto the wagon. The three of us sat in the back, hanging our legs free over the end, feet near touching the ground. Emil and Amaria sat behind Baldini, the children at their mother’s feet. Baldini snapped at the reins and talked nonsense to his mules, and we turned out of the piazza, down Via Capone, and in a few hundred feet, to my surprise, the wagon was moving at a good and respectable speed. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amari spoke something to her husband, and I see him nod and turn around.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Baldini…watch for the holes and ruts. There are children.”   </p>
<p id="page_425" class="calibre6">Baldini pulled on the reins, and the wagon slowed, but slightly. He was singing some song, Calabrian, I think, but he stopped and turned, guaranteeing Emil he was in full control of his animals.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca laughed.  “Holes and ruts, my ass. Baldini should worry about the cops.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Cops?” When I hear this word, my stomach flutters and my head turns light, as in this case I knew something was wrong. “Why should he watch for the cops?” I full expected his answer would cause me to be sick.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca patted the side of the wagon. “Everything you see, the wagon, the young mule. Everything. Stolen from a neighbor’s barn.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Shit. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca leans back against the pile of bags and suitcases.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This crazy bastard brought me to this barn, claiming it was his barn, but the door was locked, and he lost the key. He says, ‘break the lock with a bar,’ and when I did, he starts to sweat, and right off I knew it was not his barn. I grab his left arm, hard, but he swore, his right hand to God, he had permission. ‘Who owns the wagon and the mule?’ I asked him.  He smiled and said I should not worry. I took him by the collar and raised my hand, threatening to slap the smile from his face. The wagon and mule belong to <i>Giuseppe Carbone</i>, who Baldini says is losing his mind and cannot remember the year, even where he lives.  ‘I have stolen from him before,’ he says, and was shameless about it. But it is Carbone’s son, <i>Aldo</i>, who is the danger. If he finds the wagon and mule gone, he will go to the Carabinieri, less than a mile from his farm.” Luca shrugged his wide shoulders. “I am no angel, Antonino. You know it…but we are desperate.” I am ashamed to admit this, I believed Luca did right in looking the other way, as we were desperate, and borrowing a mule and wagon, that would certainly be returned, is only a little immoral. A venial sin (Patri Carmines words). A small sin, unimportant, not like a great sin that would guarantee hell fire. We never spoke on it again, but I surely expected to be thrown in a Calabrian prison, that are inferior to Sicilian prisons, like hell holes, so say men who have been in both. *<i class="calibre5">Carlo Bianca</i>, for one.       </p>
<p id="page_426" class="calibre6">“The old mule he came with. Is it his?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Probably not. I do not believe he owns the clothes on is back.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini (the thief) was vigorous and spirited for an old man, snapping the reins hard, threatening to beat the animals he did not own.  “Faster,” he said.  “I promise you will hate the bone pile,” and they seemed to understand, never missing a step.     </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Via Dicembre XIV </i>was a cobblestone road, more rut than stone, following the washed-out track beds. They say the road was built by Romans, so it has lasted near two thousand years of pounding from great armies and wagons, and horseshit and the ungodly sun. On the side of the road lay long lengths of rusting iron rail piled high, waiting to be set, and oil-soaked ties scattered over hell. Baldini claims he was told by an <i class="calibre5">important</i> friend (this is how Baldini described him) that a second set of tracks were planned to Napoli, but politicians, as they do for a living, demanded bribes from the railroad, and the workers refused to work, citing grievances against the owners, and poor pay.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The workers are killing Italia with laziness and poor work,” this important friend told Baldini, who agrees. Of course. Thieves stick together. Big thieves. Small thieves. In between.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Prison is too good for them if they refuse to work,” Baldini said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was a bad time for Italia, Baldini said, because of evil men who would not work when there was work, and the droughts, the floods, the famine, the disease and the taxes. The men left, and some never returned. Now we go. This is a bad time.   </p>
<p id="page_427" class="calibre6">“Watch for the boy,” Emil shouted at Baldini, who did not see this ragamuffin on the side of the road until the last second, when he pulled hard to the left, missing him by a whisper. The boy ran back to his house, that was broken down and dilapidated; with a front door that was gone and laying on the ground. The roof was a thing to see, half rotted off, half laying in pieces.  Worse, by far, than anything we saw on the Messina Road. I believe this boy maybe lived alone; he was filthy and frail, in need of a meal, but he was not the only one, as there is turmoil and disorder and suffering, everywhere, but only if you had eyes to see. Who would live like this, for no reason but that he wanted to? The little beggar picked up a rock and hid it alongside his body. God help us if he throws the rock and spooks the mules, as I thought on the wobbling wheel, that might collapse, and the wagon would overturn. I shouted to Baldini, but too late, as the boy flung the rock with such force he fell backward, grunting when he hit the ground. His shot was off, thank God, and the mules barely reared, but he recovered and grabbed another rock and took aim.  Luca yells out, “I will warm your ass red.” The boy laughed as he let loose his second shot, that missed the mules, but struck the side of the wagon. The mules bucked hard, making this awful mule sound, but to Baldini’s credit he pulled to a safe stop. Luca leaped off the wagon and gave chase to the boy who was a good deal ahead of Luca. “When I catch you,” is all he said. “When I catch you.” What did that mean?  The boy gives Luca the finger, then ran into the brush and was lost. Luca was pissed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Forget him,” I said. “He is probably deaf and dumb. No damage.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini had calmed the mules. “Do you know that little shit?” Luca asked Baldini, as he climbed back into the wagon.  Amaria chastised him for his bad language, for which Luca was embarrassed and apologized, swearing he would keep his temper in check, and his language fit for women and children.   </p>
<p id="page_428" class="calibre6">“I know his mother,” Baldini said, snapping the reins. “She comes into town once in a while, but I cannot say why.”  He lowered his voice and turned away from Amaria and her children. “She is not married and…and loose, I have been told.”  Amaria hears Baldini and blushed, then made the sign of the cross, and Baldini apologized, saying it is a good story and good stories must be told.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Three, four weeks ago, I think, two men, dock workers, beat her severely. She is puttana, so who cared? Maybe God, but I doubt it. The nuns refused to care for her, as she would rot in hell, anyway. “What is the use?” mother superior said. She was brought here, to this hovel, because her presence in town caused a stink among the decent women, who I guess were pissed that charged for what they give away. Baldini took no pains with his voice, and Amaria blushed, said nothing as I believe she was too embarrassed to reply. She made the sign of the cross and left it at that but asked about the house where maybe the boy lived, calling it a “hovel and unfit for animals.” Emil patted her arm and she relaxed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is she still alive in there,” Amaria asked. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who knows?”  Baldini answered with a laugh. “Her people are the lowest life there is.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They dumped her and left?” Santo asked Baldini. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, no, not exactly. They prayed over her first, so I was told.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini snaps the reins and we moved on.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This poor child might be alone?” Amaria asked Baldini, as she stretched to see the boy, who was standing near the bushes, but in plain sight. Emil took her hand. “There is nothing we can do,” he said to her. She understood, said something about “God’s children,” and stared at the boy until he disappeared, once we made the curve in the road.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazie,” her husband said to her. “The boy…pitiful, yes, but he is not family.” </p>
<p id="page_429" class="calibre6">“God help us,” she said, pulling her children close, and making the sign of the cross.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"> The countryside was vacant, depressing, grown over with ancient trees and thick brush, but no people. When I think on this boy, and the boy on the Messina Road, as I do, I wonder about my sons, my grandsons, would they have gone where those two boys went?      </p>
<p class="calibre6">After a long and quiet time, Amaria asks Baldini, “How long to the train, signuri?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“That depends,” he said, staring down the road. “With no trouble, we should be there in plenty of time, with an hour, or more to spare.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Trouble?”  I asked, “what kind of...” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Briganti</i>,” he said, without hesitation. “They have run this road for the last few months.  If they catch you and you are lucky, they only steal from you…everything you have.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria was startled, then angry. “Then my children are in danger.” Baldini did not answer her right off but he gazed at the sky and talked to the mules, and when she asked him again, he stuttered.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, no, signora, uh, of course not.  I…I spoke foolishly. The grand Italian army has chased most of them into the mountains. They, uh, …I cannot remember when they raided last.”  She was upset, maybe at Baldini, maybe at Emil, but in any case, she held her daughter closer, and the young girl sensed her mother’s fear and cried.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But you deserve honesty, signora, and I am honest when I say these bandits are crafty men. They are here and they are not here. They are there, and they are not there. Si, crafty men. Dangerous men, if you resist. But as I say the grand Italian Army has…”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Signuri Baldini? Is your name Andrea?” she asked, with a cold stare.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Andrea?” No, I am not anyone called Andrea. Why do you ask, signora?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A street peddler warned us about a man named Andrea, that’s all. We were warned.”  </p>
<p id="page_430" class="calibre6">“You think I am him?” and he laughed, like a wild man. “No, signora. I am <i>Vito</i>,” he said, holding his head high and proudly. “Named for my grandfather, *Vito Baldini, a propertied man, of noble birth. This criminal Andrea you speak of, he is a young man, not old, like me. But rest easy, they say he was taken by the Carabinieri a few days ago.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But we were told it might be a lie,” Emil said. “You know this for certain?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sometimes these stories are false…I do not know this for certain. But as the story goes,   some traitor in his band tipped the cops, for a few lire. Ten cops came for him, well-armed, itching for a fight. They would have killed him without a second thought.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then he went peacefully?” I asked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Peacefully?” Baldini grunted and shrugged his shoulders.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He is Sicilian, like you. A viler man I have…”   Suddenly, and for no reason, as I could see, the wagon slowed. I checked for bandits coming from the woods, but none came out, thank God. Baldini snapped furiously at the reins and yelled Calabrese curses, I could barely understand. The wagon stopped dead in the road, as the older mule snorted and complained, as if sick, or something like it.  Who know what is in a mule’s mind?  Baldini talks to the mule.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I think it is ailing in some way. I think it needs to…to…to flush itself, if I might say it that way.”  Baldini apologized, “Scusa, signora e signorina. He leaned and whispered. <i class="calibre5">Merda</i>, signora. It will not be pleasant. These beasts know no boundary when it comes to…to…to purifying itself, and me, I am not used to the company of gentle women.” Amaria nodded, saying such words were not new to her, but more common on this trip and it was upsetting, and should not be said in the company of women and children. He tipped his cap, “<i class="calibre5">mi dispiace</i> ,” and I believe he was sincere. “There are two things for which these beasts cannot be rushed…this is one.” The children showed good sense and covered their heads under a blanket.      </p>
<p id="page_431" class="calibre6">Baldini was right. Si, it was unpleasant as he said. Emil turned his head away and gasped for air, as sat closest to the wrong end of the mule. “Baldini, this is agony. When will it be over?”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I think *Giuseppe, the old one, has eaten bad feed. It will be over soon. It cannot go on forever.” When the old mule finished, thank God, a good wind came through and cleared some of the fouled air, but the smell lingered, and the daughter was sick to her stomach, while the boy just laughed.              </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini removed his cap, “Apologies to all of you. Farm animals. They have not been in the company of gentle people before, like you people.”  He snapped the reins and we moved on, and the old mule, cleaned out and fresh, seemed good as new.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You were telling us about this Andrea,” I reminded Baldini. He nodded.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, Andrea. Yes. Well, as early as today I was told a well-armed force of Carabinieri surrounded him, but he refused to surrender and ran into a stone shack hoping to escape. They wanted him, kicking and screaming, like a woman, I am sorry to say.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Amaria asked, “What were his crimes?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“His crimes? Mostly robbery. A few murders. His victims, fat, rich bastards. Some say they all deserve to die.” He apologizes, once more, for his rough language. “But if you are worried, I am certain he would have no interest in you…well, except that he might want to…”  He yelled to the mules, “faster,” snapping the reins, and they went faster. “But not to worry, he is surely dead by now. Shot trying to escape, whether he did the crimes or not. Who will be interested in the details? It is the way here. But never let your guard down. There are others. If they get you, and rob you, or other things, do not take it personally. Robbery is a job these days, nothing more.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A wagon came out of the shadows cast by trees along the road. A good-looking wagon, as I could tell, sturdy built, pulled by two, steady draught horses, not mules, and handled  by a young man, twenty-five, or so, clean shaven, with a build more suited to a construction worker than a carter. He pulled up his wagon in the middle of the road, and Baldini stopped alongside, wrapping the reins around a board nailed to the side of his seat. The mules bucked some but calmed down when he leaned and rubbed their hind ends.       </p>
<p id="page_432" class="calibre6">Baldini and the driver embraced and smiled together. “This is my best niputi,” Baldini said. <i>Enrico, the youngest son of my brother, </i>Orazio.” When the nephew smiled, I see only white teeth, so I knew he never smoked cigars, or chewed tobacco, and I believed he was good  with the women in his town, as he was the man women always want.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Ciao a tutti</i>,” he says to the rest of us, as he walked Baldini to the side of the road.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Baldini, we are going to miss the train,” I holler out, but he kept walking.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No worry, signuri,” the nephew answered for Baldini, “There is time. I have just come from <i class="calibre5">Mondialla</i>. The engine has minor problems, but two good men are working on it. They say it will be ready to go in a few hours.”  Baldini smiled.  “I promised I would get you to the train in plenty of time.”  He took two stogies from his pocket and give one to his nephew (I was wrong, the nephew smoked) and lit both from the flame of a single match; they both dragged deep and blew the smoke into the great outdoors, smiling, saying how good is the taste of tobacco. But me, should I live to be a hundred, I will never tolerate the taste of cigars. Vile things that they are.  These two fools puffed, and the smoke circled their heads and caught in a breeze that blew it to me, of course, and when I moved, the smoke moved with me, like it had a sense of its own.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini called to me. “Join us,” he said, and I did because I was bored, but I stood few feet away and would not breathe the air around them. “There is a cigar for each man,” he said, throwing his head back, saying how good it felt, how good it tasted. Baldini points to his nephew. “He says you will be lucky to get a seat on the train. You should have been quicker off the ferry.” </p>
<p id="page_433" class="calibre6">“We helped a woman who was injured,” I said. “I have told you a hundred times.” He nodded to his nephew. “They did and she was not even family.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Tu salute</i>,” says his nephew, raising his cigar like a toast. “Italia is dog eat dog these days.” He was sincere, I believed, as he said it with emotion, waving his arm recklessly, near knocking the stogie from his uncle’s mouth.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazie,” I said. “But it was the signora who stopped to help.” Amaria was embarrassed, she smiled and nodded to the nephew.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We missed the first train,” I said, “but we will be fine.”  Baldini slapped my back. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“These people are going to America, and their children.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Americani, huh?” The nephew shook his head, as if he was sad for us, and pitied us. “So, you men have given up on Italia…you think your life will be better in America?” I thought on calling Luca, for no reason but to slap the smile off this cavones face. But no, I would handle this fool myself.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Signuri. If I could set my ass on a comfortable wagon, and two horses did the work, maybe I would feel as you do.” He smiled and said no more on it, and this told me he heard the truth. Baldini hugged his nephew, “we must leave,” and the two wished each other good health. Baldini snapped the reins and we moved on.  About a mile out, he pointed to the side of the road, “All that is left of the rail bed destroyed by the floods.” I saw only trees and brush, not a single track or piece of mangled iron rail as I expected from such disaster. Somewhere ahead, near the horizon, black smoke was curling to the sky, and I prayed that beneath the smoke, there was an engine, running, not a burning house, or hay field.   </p>
<p id="page_434" class="calibre6">“Smell it,” Baldini said. “You can smell it from here,” and on hearing this Santo and Luca applauded our good fortune. Amaria and Emil thanked God together. Baldini turned, “Just as I …”  and at that instant a jackrabbit, his ass on fire, ran across our path, spooking both mules, who reared at the same time. The wheel that already wobbled broke into pieces, and the wagon turned on its side, throwing us to the ground. We lay on each other, like bales of hay thrown into a heap on the barn floor, and only by the grace of God no one was injured, except Baldini who could not walk. He lay cursing mules, both tangled in the rains, trying to kick themselves free as spooked mules will do, but a good hoof to the head would have split Baldini’s skull in two. They were not injured (the mules) as I could see, and once freed they ran off, with Baldini cursing them from his back on the wet ground. We gathered our bags and brought them together, piling them next to this wreck of a wagon.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This is bad,” the old man said. “Bad.” Luca and Emil helped him up, and he limped, but otherwise was in good shape. The wagon?  Not so good. A pile of boards. Firewood, at best. Baldini wept.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This is bad,” he kept repeating, “This is bad.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca yelled in Baldini’s face.  “You are acting like a woman,”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Baldini wept all the more. “The mules have run off.  I cannot walk. Who will help me?” and he continued weeping, like a small child who had lost his mother. “Who will help me?”  What was there to say, but to say, “we are sorry at your misfortune.” Emil patted his shoulder, “Someone will stop and help. We are grateful for what you did, but we must catch the train.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are leaving me here?” Baldini cursed, with no regard for the woman and children. “You sonofabitchs are leaving me...after what I did for you?” Emil patted his shoulder.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We have no choice. We are sorry, catch a mule, better the young one…ride it home.”  </p>
<p id="page_435" class="calibre4">Baldini threw his cap to the ground. “Ride a mule?  Am I twenty years old? Goddamn all of you.” He kicked the dirt with his good leg, then at Emil, then at each of us in turn, including the children, but Amaria, he spared her a kick of the dirt.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I admit this, he did not get us to Mondialla, as promised, but we decided to pay him the full amount, but he slapped it away, and panicked when he saw the coins fly through the air. He screamed murder and demanded we help him find his money or pay again. “You owe me that money…you sonofabitchs owe me the money.”  We said farewell and thanked him, again, as he sulked and carried on.  Amaria would pray for him, she said, for his safe return to Villa San Giovanni. He demanded she do for him what she did for the woman on a ferry. When Luca tired of Baldini’s ranting and vileness in front of woman and her children, he promised to send Baldini home on the end of his foot and Baldini shut up.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You give us good advice,” Luca tells him. “You are not family and we do not have the time.” Our debt was paid; that he threw his money away was not our concern.  He gave us the “<i class="calibre5">malocchiu</i>,” the evil eye, and on all our descendants. His last words were vile and angry, that he hoped our ship would sink and we were eaten by sea vermin, including the children, no matter how young and innocent. We carried the bags we could carry and dragged the rest over the rough cobblestone road toward the plume of smoke. It was getting dark; the wind picked up, a cold wind and the children shivered. In an hour, or so (who could judge the time?) we were there, at <i class="calibre5">Mondialla</i>, and not too soon as the engine was repaired, near ready to leave. Steam blew a good six feet from the engine; rich, black, sweet-smelling smoke. Fresh honey. Si. It smelled like fresh honey. We fell in at the end of the line and waited, like good Siciliani. A man, like us, tells Luca he was there for hours with two cousins and I remembered them from the ferry. He claimed they took a cart from Villa San Giovani, and it was a pleasant ride until the driver tried to rob them on the fare. They ganged up on him and beat him until he accepted the agreed to fare. Word spread that the train was leaving within the hour, but after two hours it had not moved a foot, and we were not allowed to board a car, and the children were restless and cold and many cried. Luca was so impatient, he went for seeking answers and came back spitting out the bad news, that all passenger cars were full. “Even the aisles, they say, are jammed with people standing or sitting on the floor.” He looked more grim and tired than before, but not angry, accepting that in Italia, the worst will always happen.     </p>
<p id="page_436" class="calibre6">“We ride in the box cars, like the cattle, or go home.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Emil threw up his hands (the third or fourth time since we met up).   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My family will not ride in a cattle car…maybe I can pay a little more,” but he stopped, as he remembered he had no spare money to pay, and this embarrassed him, and he looked away. Amaria gently touched his shoulder. Luca stared at the ground, “then it is the cattle car,” he said and laughed, but he laughed alone.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">A short, fat man, a red lantern held in front of his body, came out of the shadows and walked to the back of the line. I believed he was the boss, or a man of some authority, for he wore a badge, bright polished and pinned to his jacket so all could see it, and when he spoke, he thrust out his chest and he seemed to be all badge.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The cars are full,” he said, lifting the lantern to eye level, and there were shouts and cursing. This man, for his poor appearance, was the conductor, in charge of the whole train and the people surrounded him, closing in, tighter and tighter, like a noose, until he panicked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do not force me to call the law,” he said, backing away from the crowd as he waved his lantern in a threatening manner. “The law will be tough on you and your families,” he said, like a tough man, but he was not tough, but fat and clumsy. Most of the  complainers were only loud, except one fool who (not Luca) who threatened to break arms, but his friends shut him up. Luca was quiet, thank God. This cavone of a conductor took the burden of the blame, as he wore the badge and made the rules, so we thought.  He raised his voice to clear the noise from the crowd, “Let me speak,” he said, and the line quieted except for five men, who pestered him, but he never called the law.      </p>
<p id="page_437" class="calibre6">“Riding in box cars is against the rules,” he said and smiled, “unless it suits you.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">The people were desperate, and their children The others, who were not as desperate, left, saying they would come back another day.  We were herded into two lines, half for each box car (there were two). The D’Arrico’s were pushed toward the first car, and it was sure we would be separated, but Emil slyly moved his family to our line when the conductors back was turned, and many saw Emil prowl along the tracks, but no one talked. The box car was what it was, a barn, an animal pen on wheels, not fit for humans, filthy and foul smelling, with no dignity. But we were trapped, with little choice but to accept this disgrace. A woman complained her children would be sick from the smell, and I was ill, and understood what she said, and the conductor said he understood her concern, but did nothing and moved down the line. Emil settled his family in a far corner of the car, away from the open door, and we followed. Luca was pissed and kicked the wall hard; his foot broke through the boards, and he glanced through the car, as if looking for the guilty person.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Now we are the swine,” he said, kicking the wall again. Santo blocked the hole with his body, until the conductor passed by on his inspection.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">The men who cleaned this car, if it was ever cleaned, did a poor job, as I could see, leaving chunks here and there, hardened and stuck to the planked floor. The smell was powerful, as everything was soaked in piss; for the men it was not bad, but hell for the women, anyway the clean women. Another conductor, younger than the first, collected a lira from each person in the car, and though he wore a badge, he had the decency to apologize for the smell. Keep hold of your children (who were charged only half a lira), he tells the parents, as the door would be left open for ventilation. Two weeks past, a child, standing too close to the open door, fell out and under the wheels when the car jumped on a bad track. The train stopped in half a mile, or so, and the father ran back, calling the child’s name all the way.  A boy? Yes, it was a boy, and the poor mother could not be comforted, or would she go on to Napoli. Hearing this story, the mothers grabbed hold of their children, and all were pulled away from the door.      </p>
<p id="page_438" class="calibre6">It was February, the night would be cold and damp.  At ten or twenty miles an hour, the wind will be merciless, and I believed we might freeze. “They should close the door for the safety of the children,” a woman complained to the conductor, but there was no door to close; it had been stolen and for what reason no one could say. When the conductor said “door,” the door he meant was no more than an opening where the “door” had been, at some other time.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The engine jerked as it pulled the train slowly from the siding. They gathered at the door, the men, mostly Siciliani, but a few Calabrese, watching silently while the countryside passed. One by one, having seen enough, they returned to their families. I was the last to leave the door, stretching as far as I could stretch, hoping see Sicilia through the trees, but no. The car was quiet, as no one talked or made noise, or was there a natural sound but the clicking of the wheels as the train moved down the track. A door would have been a good thing to have, or a small wood stove to take away the chill.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The wind blew dirt and shit through the whole goddamned car.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The moon that night was round and pale, and by the light it cast into the car, I see the sad, hopeless faces of the women and children, and the men were hard faced and did not sleep, like sentries guarding their families. The three of us should have huddled for warmth, like the woman and children, but we did not. If I have nothing to tell when I return, I will tell will about the last few days; the walk, the ride, the crazy people, but I will never forget the sad faces I have seen, and anyone who hears will know I tell the truth.  </p>
<p id="page_439" class="calibre6">A child is crying, I hear a woman’s soothing voice. “Go to sleep,” she said, “it will be over soon.” I am ashamed to say this, but maybe I pretended she was talking to me, but I am not certain. It was a long time ago. I lay against the wall, resting my eyes, wondering if it will be worth it, what I have done?     </p>
<p class="calibre6">My arm shook. “Antonino, wake up.” It was Santo.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How long did I sleep” I asked. I felt for the motion of the car; there was none. Are we in Napoli? We must be in Napoli.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Cops at the door,” he said, in a whisper. “What is happening?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How should I know?  But keep out of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">A Sergeant of the guard stood at the door, hands on his hips; a tall man, in a spotless uniform, arrogant looking, as they are. He walked through the crowd, shining his lantern into each face, one at a time, women and children, too.  No one protested, or asked why, not me or Santo or Luca.  “We want *Enrico Malvatesta…he robbed and murdered the Mayor of Villa Mare, near here, and we know he is on this train...in this car.” We were ordered to show our papers and tell whole truth, or face prison, both men and women.  A slim man behind the crowd, turned slightly, to make himself harder to see, as I guessed. The Sergeant nodded toward this man, and two soldiers went for him, as the crowd separated, but he was trapped against the piss-soaked wall, with no way out. They demanded his papers. “May papers are lost,” he said, or stolen, in truth he did not know. A soldier grabbed his arm and the man pulled away and retreated into the corner, cowering and begging for help. “They will murder me before this train goes a mile,” he pleaded, but no one interfered, or asked a question. Was it our business? He was not family. A Carabinieri stepped back, drew his pistol and placed it firm against the man’s head. They manacled his hands and feet; at this point, he began to struggle and resist, but too late and he was caught for good, and I believed his fate was sealed.     </p>
<p id="page_440" class="calibre6">Was he the murderer?  He was sweating at his face and neck, like a guilty man would do; but me, I was sweating, and innocent.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am not Malvatesta,” he begged. “I am <i>Michele Russo…son of </i>Carmine Russo and <i>Angelina Pucci…from Napoli…going home to work the farms…I snuck on this train…I did not pay…but I am no murderer…you will be killing the wrong man.” They did not believe his story, and I see fear on his face, as he backed away, and he mumbled under his breath.  A prayer, I believe, from the look on his face. He was manacled, and it was senseless to fight, as the iron chains were so massive, he could barely raise his hands. Malvatesta, or he says Russo, went easy, without a fight, praying aloud as he walked, to </i>Santu Michele, his patron saint. They put him in a wagon drawn by two horses, a guard on each side, but when they moved to fasten his chains to the wagon, he swung his arm and struck one of his guards across the shoulder, and in an instant, it seemed, the other guard pulled his revolver and shot him once in the head. The women screamed, all of them, and a few men and the children cried. The guards fastened his body to the seat and propped him, and at this point he seemed to be alive, as he was bleeding pretty good, and cattle will bleed until they die. The conductor waved his lantern, that was shaking and throwing light in the wrong places, and the train moved on.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Was he a murderer, I ask again? He looked tough until he sweated, but he could have been a murderer. Or he was just a man with no papers.  Luca watched as the wagon moved away from the train, and he swore he heard another shot and in discussion with other men, some said it was the sound of the engine knocking, and some said it was another shot to be sure he was dead. I stayed awake, too tired, too cold to sleep, thinking of the warmth I hoped to find in the belly of the boat, and thinking about the dead man and who he was, though it was none of my business. I have thought about this man often, but that night I just wanted was to be warm.  </p>
<p id="page_441" class="calibre6">It seemed the train went on for hours.    </p>
