            <p>The years melted away like snow on the mountain. Fifty years in this new land, yet the shadow of the old country, the <em>paura</em> of being seen as less, never truly left <em>Giacomo Restunni</em>. He remembered the day he first saw the factory floor. The noise was a beast, the heat unbearable, but the necessity was a far heavier weight.</p>

            <p>He was now an old man, and his strength was a memory. He sat on the porch, watching the young ones, children of immigrants, speaking English without a trace of the beautiful accent. They did not know the cost. They did not know what the <em>padrone</em> demanded, or the shame of having nothing but your hands to sell.</p>

            <h3 style="font-style: italic;">A Glimpse of Home</h3>

            <p>His wife, <em>Signora Elena</em>, came out with two cups of espresso. She was the one constant, the anchor in the storm. She still wore the black dress, a promise to the past, a silent <em>arrivederci</em> to everything they lost. She settled beside him, her hand, wrinkled and strong, covering his.</p>

            <p>He had a moment of clarity, a flash of the Piazza, the sun on the cobblestones, the smell of baking bread. But the moment passed, replaced by the reality of the small suburban garden, the sound of a distant siren. This was his life now. This was the success they sought.</p>

            <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The New Silence</h3>

            <p>The true battle wasn't the work; it was the silence. The silence of not speaking the mother tongue, the silence of swallowed pride. He had stood straight, like a man, as <em>Giacomo Restunni</em> had taught him, but inside, he was often still the small boy, staring at the floor, afraid to look anyone in the eye.</p>

            <p>He looked at <em>Signora Elena</em>. "We did good," he whispered, the words sounding hollow in his throat. She squeezed his hand. They did what they had to do. They survived. And survival, he knew, was the only victory that mattered.</p>

            <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Survival's Victory</h3>

            <p>The sun set, painting the sky in colors too bold for their quiet street. He closed his eyes, hearing the distant, faint bells of the old church, or maybe, just maybe, he was dreaming again.</p>
