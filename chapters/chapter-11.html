        <div class="chapter-body">

<p class="calibre4">The docks were dark and lonely at night, visited by every kind of criminal and degenerate, but I did what I was told and guarded them with my life, from bandits and the thieves, for months, until one night an officer tapped my shoulder, scaring the life from me, and told me to leave.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are relieved,” he said, as he handed me a paper I could not read. “Go home, now, if you want. Do not wait until morning.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I halted patrol, resting my rifle, removed my hat and held it in both hands.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I give him a salute, that he did not return. “Sir? Can I leave in the morning?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Now,” he said, “We have no further use for your service.” He took an officer’s watch from his side pocket. “It is near midnight. You have less than an hour to find the quartermaster and return the army’s property.” I found him down the way, in a seedy bar near the barracks, and returned what they gave me, in full; two uniforms, shirt and pants (one pair ripped at the knee), a helmet I never wore, thank God, and a rifle, I had not cleaned in months, but I kept the boots and he never asked. He bitched that I should wait until morning, that he had better things to do. Drink and get drunk he meant.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The clock on the wall said it was past midnight.  I was free at last.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am my own man, again,” I tell the quartermaster, who shrugged and did not care, as I could see. He left the armies property on the table where he sat, and put what was mine in a canvas bag, and I started for home, after refusing a drink from the bartender who wanted to honor my service. I walked through the night and most of the next day until I reached the bottom of the mountain. I took two good peaches from <i class="calibre5">Sig. Cistano’s</i> orchard, and I run into <i class="calibre5">Gennini</i>, Castello’s overseer and I thought I would beat him for what wrong he caused me in the past, but he could barely speak. <i class="calibre5">Franco Gennini</i>, his only son, and a decent man was holding his arm. “A bad stroke,” he said, and he thanked God his father was not lost to the family. <i class="calibre5">Vito Benati’s</i> son (I forget his name) ran ahead to tell my mother I was home. I met her at the steps of the Chiesa Di Sant’Agatha, and she cried and prayed at the same time. She brought her friend, *<i class="calibre5">Signora Malatesta</i>, a recent widow, and they both cried and prayed together.  </p>
<p id="page_323" class="calibre7">**** </p>
<p class="calibre6">There was a derelict was in the shadows, staring out from the corner of his eye as we passed. The rotting timbers and pilings, I thought would collapse from our weight, but I kicked a few and they seemed to hold firm. Three boats were docked that night; small boats, not freighters, but boats that run between the islands, Sardinia and Corsica, sometimes to Napoli packed with lemons, or carrying rich men hiding from their wives, no questions asked. But that night I saw no ferry, and I think the worst; it was sunk or being held by the army on the mainland. If the ferry does not show, we are prisoners on this island, and will never see America, </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Always think the worst,” was my grandfather’s rule for a contented life, not a happy life, that was only meant for the landowners and politicians.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then you will never be disappointed,” he said many times. I hear him say it, and others heard him and agreed. This advice has served me well, and, yes, I admit being <i class="calibre5">pessimistico</i> most of my life; unhappy, except when I was a child and knew nothing better. Shit. Sometimes I think even Carmela, who saved me, has only made my life just bearable.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> A guard walked stooped, like an old man, on the same path I walked when I was here. One end of the dock to the other, here to there and back again; hear nothing, see nothing, think nothing. He would be dead drunk by the end of his tour, or shortly after, at <i class="calibre5">Panino’s Bar.</i> He is charged with protecting the Messina docks against thieves and vandals, but in three turns he only looked straight ahead. His only chance of catching a thief, if the thief falls out of a tree, in front of him, and breaks both legs.      </p>
<p id="page_324" class="calibre6">See nothing, hear nothing, think nothing. He could be my grandfather’s grandson.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I catch the quick movements of a man and a boy, fishing, but they had no fish as I could tell. The moon was clear and sharp, and fishing is best under a bright moon; there should have been fish in the creel, unless they were thieves or vandals, and in that case, they were safe, as this <i class="calibre5">cavone</i> walking guard will never catch on. The boy nudged the man, who blocked with his body something he wanted to hide, and starred holes through me when I passed.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">The Messina dock is poorly lit, by oil lamps strung every eight feet, or so, along wooden posts, and the orange light from the burning oil, casts a peculiar glow on what it touched. Some animal leaped from the rocks to the dock, and coiled its body, ready to attack; a filthy cat, and there are hundreds here, feeding on rats and dead fish and fighting to the death any other cat for a good meal. They are cunning beasts, and her surprise near sent me out of my skin. Female cats are the worst, most aggressive. I kicked at her and missed; she hunched, showing long teeth, but a sharp kick from Luca sent her over the side, and she struggled and cried before sinking in the black water. These cats cannot swim, and I am grateful to God for this small favor. She was just trying to survive, too bad she had to die, but it <i class="calibre5">was</i> Luca who murdered her, not me. I do not like cats. Or did Luca. Santo had no opinion, but I believe, secretly, he had some affection for these beasts, as I have seen him pick up strays and stroke the fur.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Stroking cat fur? <i class="calibre5">No maschile</i>, and I would not do it, or have I ever done it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">To hell with the cats and guards and rotted timbers. I was so tired I could barely follow a straight line; my legs burned from the long walk, and my eyes were full of soot and smoke dust. Fellino had let us down. Where do we sleep tonight, and not get knifed in the ribs by some briganti, or bothered by cops, or kept awake by cats fighting over a dead rat, or a rotted fish that washed up on shore. Spend a lira for a room or find a stable? Luca would not sleep in another man’s house, but Santo had no opinion. I appeal to Luca, who still refused, saying he would sleep, “<i class="calibre5">gratis</i>,” free, under the stars, near the ferry station, and be first in line when the ticket office opened.  </p>
<p id="page_325" class="calibre6">We planned poorly, leaving no room for error. It was my fault.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">We have planned to take a ferry(if it runs) across the Straits of Calabria, to <i class="calibre5">Villa San Giovanni</i>, and the train to <i class="calibre5">Napoli</i>, where the <i class="calibre5">Antonio Lopez </i>will be docked and loaded with food(we hope to God) and fuel, for the trip to America. I have been to <i class="calibre5">Napoli</i>. <i class="calibre5">Napoli</i> is a <i class="calibre5">grande citta;</i> brutal and dangerous in the night, like Messina, but a thousand times worse. For a week I guarded the docks in Napoli, while the rest of my company trained in the woods, for war. What war? Any war, I heard against the colored people in Africa.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are always at war,” *Lieutenant Alphonso Jacobi said. “Not always a shooting war.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">War, but no war? This is peace? No? The shooting war never came for me, thank God. I escaped the horror of it. My brother, Salvatore, did not. He was part of it, until they blew him up, because he was where the shell landed, and for no other reason. This is what I hear.      It was there, in Napoli, walking the docks, when I made this decision, that my life might be </p>
<p class="calibre6">better if I left Sicilia, for somewhere else. Anyplace with no kings. I  thought  “<i class="calibre5">L’america,</i>” where they say men are free to make their own way. What did I know? I see the  men and women who come to Napoli, only to leave, believing like I did, that somewhere else, </p>
<p class="calibre6">anywhere, was a better place to be. <i class="calibre5">L’america, argentina, il chile.</i> Anywhere. The men,  women and children who came, walked a mile, or a hundred miles, or hundreds of miles, on foot,  </p>
<p class="calibre7"> </p>
<p id="page_326" class="calibre4">on horses or broken-down mules, or in carts packed with everything they owned, or everything  </p>
<p class="calibre7"> </p>
<p class="calibre4">hauled on their backs, or suitcases banded by rope, because the locks were broken and the  </p>
<p class="calibre4">handles were missing. What they could not bring on the boat, was sold cheap, or left on the docks and they turned their backs and walked away. If they sold it, they were cheated out of desperation, but it was all part of the plan. The old mules, good for nothing, were set free and the broken-down carts were left on the side of the road. People died on the way; always the weakest, the oldest and the children, and the rest, the survivors, limped to the boat, suffering some way from the long walk. Most made it in one piece, and I believe this counted for something. I remember the man with no shoes, who stopped me and begged, “where is a doctor,” but what could I do?  His left shoe fell off his bleeding foot some thirty miles back; but no matter, he had sold his right shoe for a quarter loaf of bread, because he had nothing to eat for days, except what he could steal, and he prayed for forgiveness. His feet were raw and bleeding, pus oozing from between the toes. It is night, I said, and no doctor worked at night, unless he went into the city and found a hospital who would treat him, but he would miss the boat. Two young men, fire in their eyes, each took an arm and helped him off his knees where he thanked God for guiding him to the boat, and he prayed for his brother who died on the way, and was buried in a stand of beech trees, off a lonely road, whose name he could not remember. They were from Foggia, he told God, too far to bring his brother home. He wept and prayed as he wept, and then went on alone, not as good a man as he was before his brother died, but thankful to be alive, even in this horrible world. He says to God his brothers’ body was buried under the trees along the road, because it was too far to turn back.       </p>
<p id="page_327" class="calibre6">“Please ask my brother not to hate me because I denied him a Catholic burial.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">We cannot be late to Napoli. Nothing is more important.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">There were four men each night on the detail and a few officers, who sometimes got drunk, but a drunk officer was a better officer. When they were drunk, they were blind and we relaxed, sometimes sitting under an oak, to sleep or eat. I lived in a small tent with two men; sometimes three men, four one time. I cannot describe it, the shame I felt when I roll against another man, in that crowded tent. To complain about this, the shame, was a fool’s errand, as it meant extra duty, or the brig, and no sane man would do it. Rules? There were no rules. The rules were what they wanted the rules to be at that moment.  Complaining was to challenge the meaning of their life. In truth it was the gulls, not the officers; bird shit everywhere, on everything, like a rough coat of gray paint. At the end of my twelve hours, (maybe more if they said so), I was covered head to foot with bird shit, like a statue in the piazza. Prisoners cleaned the bird shit, and they did it on their knees, but it soaked the air, and you could feel it and hear it under your feet, with every step. The smell, like a garbage pit in Agosto, steaming raw in the sun. Twice the first week I threw up; the men laughed and said it was part of the job and I would get used to it, and I did.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">We chose camp in the woods that first night, but close to the docks that we could make the ticket line in the morning. We had to be first, or close to first, as first is best, and a guarantee of a place in line. Luca picked a small clearing, a hundred feet inside the tree line. Santo collected wood for a fire; the right fire, not too big that we attract attention, or too small that we freeze if the temperature dropped during the night. This was a test of survival, not a military test, as we were not armed, except Luca with his relic of a pistol, or were we under orders, but free men; not army, or officers, or the capu and their overseers.    </p>
<p id="page_328" class="calibre6">Santo is a collector, mostly <i class="calibre5">spazzatura</i> (junk, or garbage)other men did not want. On his first trip he went to the water’s edge, where he collected an arm load of driftwood, that burns hot and fast, not enough to last until daylight. He shaped the driftwood into a neat circle, throwing straw and dried seaweed into the pit, and it caught easy with a spark from the flint he took from his poke. The fire rolled quick, stoked by the good bay breezes. He announced, proudly, that he had made a good fire. I sat close to the flames, like a tired old dog, his time left on earth measured in days, not years. I throw a small log into the pit; watched it roll back, as it kicked up a million glowing embers, but it was slow to catch. Clouds at sea covered the bright moon, and everything was black, except for the glow in the pit. I would have wished away these clouds, if  I has the power<i class="calibre5">, </i>as they covered the brilliance of the moon, but I reasoned it would be colder and I cannot sleep in the cold. Santo tossed in the last piece of driftwood, stirring the embers with a length of rusted iron he found at the waterline. The wood caught and we had, maybe, another hour of heat and comfort. I cover my shoulders with the blanket my grandmother made, her gift that she started to knit the day I told her the army would soon get me. She cried and made the sign of the cross. I was her first grandchild to go. Her friend for life, *Signora Libertini, had information the army had no blankets and the soldiers slept on the wet ground, and a few froze to death in the high hills. Nonna was old and ill and confused, and the blanket she made was too small, better for a young child, as it barely covered my shoulders. I brought it along out of respect for her, and for no other reason.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I could see Santo through the orange flames, on the other aside of the pit, where he was struggling to find a decent spot on the ground, like I was doing, except I was calm, and he cursed, something I rarely heard him do. He claims to be a religious man, and he is sometimes, and cursing is not part of his nature. He claimed his wife, Agatha, packed poorly, keeping the best blanket for herself. A selfish thing, he said, but a quality he saw in  her many times. A small piece of wood exploded, scattering embers through the air, carried by a pretty good sea breeze toward the trees.  </p>
<p id="page_329" class="calibre6">Luca fell off fast, his last words that night were of a complaining nature; the bad fire, the hard ground, the and the ferry that was not there. I tried to sleep; Santo pestered me, like a child, with talk that made no sense. The fire died quickly; no flame, only dim embers, that cooled too fast and was of little value. Cold. I hate it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino? Are you asleep?” Three times he asks.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You remember old man *Martulli and his two daughters?  <i class="calibre5">Madonna mia</i>, they would tempt a saint. You remember them?  How could you forget?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I laugh. “Si. Am I dead? Of course, I remember them.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Then he tells me things I never knew; how he hid in the brush, waiting for the two daughters to leave the orchard, where they picked for their father. This I never knew.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I lay on my stomach until I see them coming down the orchard path; they always walked close, side by side. I was sweating like a goat in the sun. My God. What gorgeous girls. Sisters. The two of them. Sisters. I can only dream.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I hear the older girl…what was her name, threw a rock at you. Is it true?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He was quiet, except I could hear him stir.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. Not a rock. A small stone. It was nothing. They were protected by their brother, or a cousin. What was his name?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. Neither. No relative. It was *Carlo something. Martulli’s foreman. A tough bastard, but I hear he was a gentleman and a good friend to the older girl.”  He laughed. “Si, a good friend,” I repeated, “What was her name?” </p>
<p id="page_330" class="calibre6">“Giovanna. *Giovanna Martulli. You are right. Old man Martulli worked him like a mule, and he worked the oldest daughter.” We laughed. “They were beauties, those two girls. When I see them walking together, my God, I would make the sign of the cross. One day I see Carlo on the path, drunk, babbling away like some fool. He grabbed my arm and leans into my face, spitting like the drunk he was. “They are both in the stream,” he said. “Cleaning themselves. Bare ass.” I could barely breathe, my heart beating so hard it hurt. I run to my spot near the foot bridge. They were just walking away, but I see their hair, wet, soaking wet, tied in a knot and they bounced…in front…bounced as they walked. Bounced. You know what I mean?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you speak to them?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I did, but they laughed, kept on walking.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tell me this, Santo. How much time did you spend in the bushes? </p>
<p class="calibre6">Silence from his side of the fire. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Santo. Did you spend…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I choose not to answer this question,” he says, “But I can say they cleaned themselves, all bare assed in the stream, from time to time. I know this to be true, but I cannot say how.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">The dying embers floated on the wind, toward Santo, and landing on his blanket, but he brushed them away. He cursed his wife. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What did you ever see?” I ask. “*A tetta, maybe? Due tette?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He sighed. “No tetta,” he said. “Nothing but the air. <i class="calibre5">Niente</i>. Only in my mind.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Forget it. Sleep. I respect you as an honest man.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But I see her now. She is standing in front of me, all bare ass. It is *Santina, the young one. Where is Giovanna? They should be together; It has always been my dream.”  </p>
<p id="page_331" class="calibre6">“You know she is not really there. If I thought she was there, I would be there. We need sleep. Tomorrow is a busy day. Forget the *Martulli girls.” I hear him say, “<i class="calibre5">Ciao</i>, Santina. Clean yourself in the ocean…it is through the trees…next time bring your sister.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Santo? Are you awake?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am not asleep.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Remember the rock. Just for saying “ciao” to her? No?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. But not hard. Only a small rock. It was worth it to be close.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your wife? Do you think about your wife?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She kept the good blanket for herself. And she is not here.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you see an old man coming at you, swinging a club?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, I do. Martulli. That cavone. Come and get me, you sonofabitch.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Santo. Think about America. Forget Martulli…his naked daughters.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, America,” he answered. “Not an easy thing. Santina is still here. <i class="calibre5">Queste due belle tette</i>. Let me touch them…just once.” There came quiet from his side of the pit.    </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Santo. Are you awake?” I hear moaning.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ahhhh…they feel good,” he says. “Worth a good beating if her father catches me.” This was the last sounds I heard of him that night. Who am I to judge?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Every few minutes a boat rings the bell five times. Maybe the pilot saw a rock, or maybe another boat. A freighter? Or a dingy he saw, taking a fisherman from Messina to Calabria, or the other way. Then a steady horn, and five bells cutting through the darkness. Darkness is another fear I have. I prayed it was not a freighter, or a dingy, or some drunk fisherman, but our ferry coming to dock. That was the last I remembered.  </p>
<p id="page_332" class="calibre6">I sit up and grabbed at my back. I was laying on a pointed rock, that I dug from the ground and threw into the woods. I ached. My gut was uneasy, telling something was wrong. I rolled on all fours, like a dog, then stood and stretched. Where is Luca? Gone. The sonofabitch is gone with his pack, but our ferry was in her slot.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I panicked, like a woman.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">I yelled, “Santo, Get up. We are going to miss the god dammed ferry.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Huh, what’s wrong?”  He rubbed his eyes. “What time is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I scream, “Get your ass going,” but he was in a daze, staring at me, not a muscle moving, so I yelled again, jerking the blanket off his body.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Luca is gone,” I said to Santo, as he cleaned his eyes. I struggled with my boots, to pull on my boots, bouncing on one leg. I tripped over the fire pit, that was cool, thank God. I run to the edge of the clearing, stepped on a sharp rock, and cursed everything on God’s earth. I see a line at the ferry gate, with another line at the ticket office. I limped back to Santo, still curled in a ball, sleeping like a child, and I give him a sharp kick on the side of his leg, that startled him and he sits up straight.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Huh! Ugh…what…what is happening?” He looked at me and scowled. “You,” he said, pushing up off the ground, and resting on his knees, groaning like a dying man. “Shit. What time is it?” I took his arm. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are late. There is a line.” He stared at me, then wiped the crap from the corner of his eyes, and brushed the dead grass and burrs from his clothes. He scratched, complaining on his poor night’s sleep, because his wife had packed the bad blanket and kept the good one for herself. The same shit. Always the same shit.    </p>
<p id="page_333" class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Ho fame</i>,” he mutters. “I am hungry. I need food before I can move. A biscotti, or a little something. Not much, a little food. My stomach is making noises.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No time, come on. The line is getting long…we will be left out.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But I have biscotti in my sack…for both of us.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Luca is gone. Forget the goddamned biscotti.” I pulled his arm, like pulling on a stubborn mule, as I cursed Luca for running, like only a coward would do. Wake me. Tell me you are going home; say you are leaving for good, at least I would pace all night and not oversleep, or maybe we would follow him home. I remembered papa. What he said about Luca: “He will fall, and when you grab to save him, you fall. He will survive and you will die. Luca is this kind of man.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Two cops stood guard at the ticket office, to keep order and throw out the troublemakers. A short, fat cop, and a tall cop, a Carabinieri; both armed with rifles, French, I think, and extra ammunition in pouches; not slung on the shoulder, but at the side, at rest. The line was calm, no pushing, nr shoving, or complaining as I could tell. Sicilianu are civilized by the end of a barrel jammed in the small of the back. Santo shakes his head.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Luca is gone. Not here. On his way home, maybe. But you know him. He will show at the last minute. You will see. But he cannot be trusted.” I half-assed agreed.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The Carabinieri brought his rifle high, at the shoulder, for the crowd to see. He cleared his throat, and spoke harshly, but he spoke well. In the manner of an educated man (the Carabinieri read and write, even the Sicilian Carabinieri). He says in a deep, steady voice, showing some authority, “The ferry to Calabria will leave shortly, as promised.” He stared at the crowd and the crowd went silent, but some looked away. He read from a paper held close to his chest. I thought, maybe he needs glasses.    </p>
<p id="page_334" class="calibre6">“But all other departures are canceled, by order of the Military Command. When it is…”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The ferry was too small to carry every man who wanted to go, and the crowd became loud; finally, so loud, so disorderly, it was useless for him to speak, as there were shouts and taunts and questions from the ticket line, and he answered in the manner all questions are answered, by showing his rifle, the butt end resting on his hip. An untidy woman, who was alone, shouted obscenity from the crowd, but directed it to no particular man, or woman. An old man stood at my side, near seventy and stooped. He took my arm, like we were old friends. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you hear about the killings?” he asked, but calmly. </p>
<p class="calibre6">I lied, but for good reason.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Killings? No. was there a killing?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“More than one killing. ‘Killings,’” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Killings? We heard one. Maybe it was deserved it, or he was <i class="calibre5">brigante</i>, or a murderer, himself, not just some fool protesting on the dock, who would not move when ordered to move. Fellino said it was only one. So did the old fool on the mule.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then it happened,” I said. “Or are you passing on a bad rumor?” He waved his hands in the air.          </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It happened,” he said. “The slaughter. Over there,” and he pointed to a spot near the ferry, then at the Carabinieri.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Those bastards murdered for no good reason. In cold blood, and before the body hit the dock, there was anarchy. People running crazy everywhere, woman and…” I put my hand in his face to stop his mouth from running.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, you were here?” He stopped and thought.  </p>
<p id="page_335" class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Was</i> I here?” He thought. “No, I was not,” he finally answered. “But my information comes from a solid man, who I trust. *<i class="calibre5">Enrico Balazzino</i> .” He paused, staring hard, like in a daze.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you know him?” He covered his mouth to hide the words, as he watched the Carabinieri watching the crowd of people, but I swear he was watching only me.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe it was the bastard up there,” he said, as he turned his back, pointing to the Carabinieri with his shoulder. “Who knows? I hear the dead were from Milazzo, west of here, I think. One of the dead, a young man, was going to meet his brothers in America.” He laughed, something like a fools laugh. “I would like to see that reunion take place.” He smiled, and I wondered how a man smiles at a tragedy like he describes. He made the sign of the cross. In the name of the Father and the Son and the holy ghost. He pointed to his eye, then his ear.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Watch who you listen to, and only believe what I say. There are cavones and troublemakers and government men all over the place. Like weeds, they come from the cracks in the street.” He laughed. “Trust only your mother, if she swears on a stack of bibles.” The other cop, only a constable, pulls a cigar, a stogey, from his breast pocket. Constables are inferior to Carabinieri, they say. I am a poor judge of cops, only that I hold them in low regard, like my father and my grandfather do. Everyone knows the cops answer to the owners, and the owners own everything else.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Marmaglia</i>(rabble),” the fat ass constable says, loud and with contempt, as he looks across the line of men and women, everyone praying they could still buy good tickets on the last boat from Sicilia, for who knows for how long.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Marmaglia</i>. All <i class="calibre5">marmaglia</i>,” he says again, now looking straight at me, but I am sure he meant the others, as there were more ragged men in line. He squints, bites off the tip of his cigar, spitting it at the line of men. He kept on his rant, like a preacher, or a priest and this was a sermon and it was Sunday, but it was not.    </p>
<p id="page_336" class="calibre6">“These mobs…this rabble in front of me, nothing but trouble,” he said, his voice carrying well across the Sicilian crowd, but thankfully, by our breeding and culture, we ignore insults from these men. “Let them go, and good riddance,” he says, a devious grin on his face. “The American law will deal with these rabble. I hear they hang a few as a lesson to the many.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought of a question. </p>
<p class="calibre6">If we buy tickets and are turned away, or jailed, do we get our money back?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The pezzonovante give back money? I am a damn fool?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Wipe your ass with the tickets,” they will say, and we are stuck with worthless paper.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How many?” the agent asks, without looking up, and not politely. I believe he was weary, though it was early morning. Being too slow to answer his question, this pissed him off, and he asks again, “<i class="calibre5">Biglietti? Quanti</i>?”  One last look for Luca. No Luca. I raise three fingers.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Tre biglietti, per favore.</i>” Three tickets.  “Are they good if we do not make the ferry?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He stares at me, then smiled. He points to words painted on a board. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You see the sign? What does it say?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I see the sign. Red letters on white.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you read?” he asks me. “Of course, you do not read, or you would not be here.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked to see if other men were listening, then I nod, and he knew. </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">“Nessun rimborso,”</i> he says. No refunds. “Save them for the next ferry, if there is one, or throw them in the bay for all I care…next.” I nodded and paid. That was that. I walked to Santo, who was leaning against an oak tree, and staring out across the bay. He sees three tickets in my right hand.  </p>
<p id="page_337" class="calibre6">“You bought one for Luca?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Right? If he shows. But he will not. What else could I do? He is one of us, no matter.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, yes, our partner. But we are better off he is not here.” I ignored him. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Like we were both kicked in the ass at the same time, we run double time to the ferry, passing a hundred bastards dragging themselves toward the ticket office, and great disappointment. For me and Santo, I believed we could still make the ferry; I refused to give up as long as I could run and breathe. We pass a soldier walking the line; not a cop, or a Carabinieri, but a full out soldier, armed with a rifle, fixed bayonet, ready to thrust it into some helpless sonofabitch, even a woman. Another <i class="calibre5">boccalone</i>, a big mouth, like the fat cop at the ticket office, only standing in a different place. Maybe they are brothers, I think, at least from the same father, as they were both fools. This one I could hear shooting off his mouth from a hundred feet. He talks to the men in line, only the men, and he points to five or six, in no special order </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If it was up to me, I would let none of you back in the country, not even on your knees. You piss on the country of your birth, and when you fail in America, you crawl home like children, begging for your mother’s milk…not me. I would slam the door in your fucking faces.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He walked, no, he swaggered along the line, more German than Sicilianu. Himself, he was  <i class="calibre5">brutè;</i> a pock marked man, with head problems, but his uniform was clean, like a good officer, but he was no officer. I knew soldiers like him, who talked shit and played with their rifle like a toy, rubbing the bayonet, that was always clean and razor sharp, like a meat cutting knife. These men, the cop and the guard and Carribieneri, love the life I flee.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The Master (harbor boss) turns to the soldier at his side, and they speak almost face to face. The soldier starts counting at the front of the line, men, women, children, no matter. One hundred twenty-five passengers. No more. Not one more, not even God, Himself.  </p>
<p id="page_338" class="calibre6">“Uno, due, tre, quattro…” he counted. At “cento venti-cinque,” one hundred and twenty-five, he stopped and scrubbed his boot along the ground, making a mark where the count ended, and every soul past that mark was out. Out. They could not go today. When could they go? Maybe tomorrow, or never. Me and Santo, we were one hundred twenty and one hundred twenty-one. I clench my fist and say a prayer. The men behind us, after one hundred twenty- five, were out. They were out, not allowed on this ferry. We made it by five or six, thank God, and I look at Santo, who was smiling, wide, but me, I cannot say the feeling I had, of being born again, and all this was something good, but I was sorry Luca chose to go home, or he was dead, or in jail or busted up and left in a ditch. The men, the culled men, were ordered to leave the line; come back another day, but who could say when, if ever. Culled from the line, like animals plucked for slaughter, and there is no appeal from the end of a rifle barrel.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Too many just hang around,” the soldier says to the Master, who agrees.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Move them out,” was the order, and the soldier smiled and begins pushing the unwilling out of line. Did I care? No. Why should I care? I was picked, and this is what mattered to me; part of the chosen, for the first time. We were with them, and they were not against us. A good feeling, I admit. I think, maybe, I have been wrong all my life; the chosen are not so bad.    </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Hurry up! Do your job,” the master yells at the soldier, who was pushing the unwilling, and anyone who refused to leave. The Master was old and stooped over; his hands trembled. I figure he was a brother, maybe a cousin, or uncle of some politician, or he bought his job, plain and simple. Did I say his hands trembled?  When he walked the line, inspecting things, he limped and scowled, every time his left foot touched ground, as if he was in great pain. He leaned on his cane for support when he rested, that was every few steps. I felt no pity that he was old and in pain; he was my enemy, who would order me off the line, just to see if I complained. The Master has friends, he has power. I have friends, but I have no power, or do my friends have power. He cleared his throat, straightened his body and prepared to speak, and every man and women turned his way and listened, even the men who were pushed out of line.   </p>
<p id="page_339" class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si prega,</i>”  he said, without smiling.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">There was calm for the moment, as I think many of the culled believed, or hoped they would be allowed to go. I did not believe it. The <i class="calibre5">pezzonovante</i>(big shots) never change their minds. I believe it is a law, that the rules they enforce have been written in heaven, approved by God, Himself., and who can argue with that, or change a word? The wind shifts to the line, and a thick, choking, cloud of blue smoke from the idling ferry, hung in the air, above the head of an average size man. I held my nose and turned away; mothers, the good ones, covered the children with their own bodies, or pulled them under a coat or shawl.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Poison. God damned poison,” I hear an old man say; a grandfather, I believe, or old enough to be a grandfather. He grumbled under his breath, wondering, was he heard by some <i class="calibre5">pezzonovante</i>. The old man caught my eye and we nodded.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Listen for another word about this morning’s run,” the Master said, but now polite and in a civilized tone, as he looked over his spectacles and across the crowd. He cleared his throat.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The government (the Army)allows this ferry to carry only one hundred and twenty-five passengers. Not one more. My men have counted off that number, and now the army tells me it is taking twenty-five seats, for soldiers on the way to fight bandits in the hills of Calabria.” There were groans and complaints from the line. Us, me and Santo, we were in, now we were out, but no official had yet ordered us to leave, but I expected we would see the end of a barrel, soon than later.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">The Master pulled a paper from that appunti (clipboard) he carried close to his chest.   </p>
<p id="page_340" class="calibre6">“There are <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> in the mountains above Villa San Giovanni. Our valiant army will capture them all or kill the ones who will not surrender.” Si, of course, there was applause and joy from the line, the loudest coming from the first one hundred, as I could tell. This is where the patriots stood, the first one hundred spots. The last twenty-five, including me and Santo, were not patriotic, and we complained loudly, and a few shouted, “fuck the army” or “fuck the bandits.” We said nothing.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The Master offered his apology.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Mi dispiace. I am sorry, but other ferries to Calabria and Napoli are canceled, and none will run unless we receive permission from government officials.” He shrugged. “Today? Tomorrow? Who knows?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why is this?” a young man asks me, as if I should know. I looked confused, just to keep him away.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I do not know why,” I say, playing dumb and safe. But the truth, as I knew it, too many <i class="calibre5">contadini</i> were leaving and the fields are empty of workers, and the few crops that will grow in drought, are dying, and the politicians blame us for the famine. A woman who was culled, pushed through the crowd and stood in front of the Master and challenged him, attacking with harsh words and hysterics, a woman’s greatest weapon besides the other things.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My mother is dying,” she yells. “Do you have no conscience…will you let her die alone?” She waved her arms, as she cried; she moved closer and I see he was nervous and asked for a soldier to shoo her away, with the tip of his bayonet. I do not believe she was poked. </p>
<p class="calibre6">What man would poke a woman with his bayonet, if he did?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am sorry, signora,” he said, as she backed off from the bayonet, “I cannot extend you special treatment. This is a military matter. See the district commander who is not here.”   </p>
<p id="page_341" class="calibre6">Seeing this harsh treatment of a helpless women, a group of culled men turned hostile, and the Master stepped back and asked for calm and civilized behavior. The woman was comforted by a young girl, maybe her daughter; she cried, hysterically, believing she would never see her mother again.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">There was brewing a rebellion by another group who gathered off to the side. The soldier threatened whoever dared interfere with the Italian Army (he said, ‘Italian Army’ boldly and proudly) but the troublemakers challenged him with foul language, and he looked fearful. The soldier raised his rifle, a sign he was losing control, and I wondered, did the riot start this way? A few of the culled, the oldest men, accepted their fate and started to leave, as ordered. A man and women, each carrying a child too young to walk, tried for the ear of the Master, and failing this, they went to the soldier. He ignored them, these invisible people, and they went away. From the corner of my eye, I see twenty-five soldiers, double timing toward the ferry; each set up in full field dress and carrying a French rifle and a backpack, ready to conduct business with briganti in the hills. They loaded onto the ferry, in a swift, but orderly march past the passengers. I checked faces, looking hard at each man who passed me, wondering, would he come back alive, or would he be just dead, or dead and in pieces. This is wrong, that Calabrian <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>, common criminals, can upset an honest man’s life. What sense did this make? Who is to blame? I needed someone to blame. When all the soldiers were loaded onto the ferry, the deck hands carried on cases of ammunition, and boxes of <i class="calibre5">razioni</i> (rations), canvas bags to pack the men who would not make it home on their own. I mean dead men.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Briganti are brutal men, even to killing prisoners and women; a few children, I have heard. I made the sign of the cross. Santo shook his head, and he made the sign of the cross.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Let’s go home. Luca is already there. I will wager my last meal on it.”   </p>
<p id="page_342" class="calibre6"> “We will be the village fools,” I said. “We have planned poorly.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo scuffed at the ground. “Where did the sonofabitch go?(referring to Luca).”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Si, he was gone, but in my heart, could I believe he would leave us alone? More the truth, I thought he was dead, or half dead, in some ditch, the victim of his own temper. Hands in my pocket, I paced in small circles, staring at the ground, as foolish as a man could look. Papa says only an empty-headed man, or a drunk, walks with hands in his pockets. I kicked the ground; a cloud of dust swirled and settled.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “God damn his soul. Goddamn Luca and this goddamned boat!” I kicked my suitcase, hard, with the side of my boot. I threw my cap toward the water and reached for the quiver of  vines on my shoulder. It flew through the air and landed hard, but the vines did not scatter.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Disperazione</i>. Despair. What is more horrible than to see no way out?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I despaired on the dock, and I despair now, in this place. I see no way out. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Patri Carmine preaches, “<i class="calibre5">Mai la disperazione,” </i>never despair. “The worst of all sins is to believe God has abandoned you. There is a special place in hell for men who despair.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was nervous quiet. The wind seemed to have stopped and no birds flew in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino Sparacino! Pisano. Over here…and move your ass.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who said that?” I ask Santo.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Said what? I heard nothing.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino, over here!” The second time I heard it, it was louder and closer, somewhere near the gangplank. I walked a few feet to my right, for a look down the line, but I saw no one who would call my name. I passed it off. <i class="calibre5">Antonino</i> is a common name. I knew twenty “<i class="calibre5">Antonino’s</i>” myself.  </p>
<p id="page_343" class="calibre6">When the detachment loaded, the officer in charge handed the Master a paper and they argued; quietly, at first, then loud, and there was cursing, but not much. The soldier nodded and retreated to the ferry after a crisp salute to the Master, who announced boarding of civilians would begin. Men and women gathered their children who strayed, and the line straightened, and they readied to leave. I hated them all, I admit, even the women and children. They had what was mine; what I worked for all my life. Why should they be free and not me? Because I overslept? Was it a sin against God? We were culled from the line, only two goddamned miles from Calabria. Two miles, or two thousand? No difference.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I feel a hard slap on my back, that near put me to the ground.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino, you sonofabitch. Are you taking the ferry, or swimming to Calabria?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">When I turned around, pissed off, ready to fight(unusual for me), I stared into the bloodshot eyes of Luca Ponto, who had come up behind me, like some bandit in the night. I shake my fist in his face.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where the hell have you been? We lost our place in line because of you.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Get you bags,” he says. “The best place in line is ours.” I laughed and mocked him.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh. The best place in line. And what will these people do? Step aside and let us in? What will they say ‘you want our place in line? Certainly. Of course. Take our food, our women and a few of the children.’ Luca slapped me again and laughed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You mock what you do not understand, my friend. I have made us a good deal, and tell the truth, Antonino, who makes a better deal than me?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Deal? What deal?” </p>
<p id="page_344" class="calibre6">“A deal. Payment for a past favor. But I warn you…men we set back will be pissed, as their place in line now our place in line. But we are late. You cavones can stay and worry, like old women. Me? I am on my way to America.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How is this possible?” Santo asks. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have made a deal for three places in line.” He pauses. “Are you two with me or are you staying here?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Without further protest, we grab our bags and run like a good wind to the ferry gate. All the way I think, if this is true, we are the luckiest men in the world. We are like thieves, on our way to steal a place in line; a place that was rightly another man’s property. For what reason, I think of that sonofabitch <i class="calibre5">Castello; </i>he would do this with a smile on his face.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The race to the gate was a blur, and this eased me, some, as I could not see the faces of the people we were cheating out of their place in line. But a blur is not a face. I hit a woman who stepped outside the line, knocking her to the ground; she was not injured, but angry, and cursed me plenty. I stopped and went back to where she lay. “<i class="calibre5">Mi scusa</i>,” I said, and offered her my hand, but she cursed, more, and tried to spit in my face. Luca elbowed his way to the front, and there was shoving, and two very angry men complained we stole their places in line. Luca called to the soldier guarding the line, who came in three steps, and stood between us and the men who had the spots Luca took.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">This soldier, a man with a fierce face, scowled and bullied to make his point.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who is causing trouble in my line?” he says, showing teeth (and spaces where there were teeth, at one time) while stiffly holding his rifle, like a battering ram.  </p>
<p id="page_345" class="calibre6">“Who is the cavone?” he asks, pointing his rifle at the oldest of the two complainers,  who should have been the wisest, but was not, until he felt a rifle barrel in his gut. He turned white and for an instant, I felt sorry for him.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who has the problem?” he demanded. No one spoke or grunted and me and Luca and Santo starred at the ground, like thieves caught in the act of thievery.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If there is trouble here,” he said, staring straight on at the complainers, who were cowering like beat dogs. “I throw you both off the dock.” He pulled the barrel out of the old man’s gut and leans into his face.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Capisce, signore?” Neither answered.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Capisce?” he repeated, louder, and they both nod.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He walked away, to where he stood when Luca called him over.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">A viler looking man I have never seen, and these poor bastards, who stood second and third in line(after Luca, who was first)now stood fourth and fifth. I wonder, what difference did it make to them? First or fourth? Pride? Maybe? What else? But for us, we were saved; minutes ago, we were cut and culled, and now we stood second and third, behind Luca, who stood at the head of the line.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Was there justice in it? None, as I could see. What did I care?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Patri Carmine says, “the last shall be first.” Or nearly first. Now Luca was first.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Luca? <i class="calibre5">Mio Dio</i>, where have you been?” I stutter when I am excited, like *<i class="calibre5">Giacomo Petrino, </i>the fool back home, who never made sense, but he remembered every birthday he heard. His mother swore he was a genius.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca laughed. “<i class="calibre5">Ho camminato. </i>I went for a walk, that’s all. But I am glad you old women worried about me.” Santo slapped him on the shoulder.  </p>
<p id="page_346" class="calibre6">“We thought you gave up and went home.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not yet, my friend. You know me. I shoot off my mouth. I needed to be somewhere else, so I walked into the city. Not far. Less than a mile from here.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I shook my head. “At night? Alone?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“For a while,” he said. “To find some life.” This means he went looking for a drink, or a <i class="calibre5">puttana</i>(whore), or both.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The good bars close early, so I come back,” meaning the whores were in for the night.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“About three in the morning…si, about three, I found a spot over there and fell asleep.” He points to a bench under a stand of trees, where four old men were squatting for the day. It was barely daylight, and one of the men was asleep, already, a bottle clutched in his hand. Drunk by daybreak. I have nightmares, that this sight is my fate.       </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “I was tired, so I lay down to rest my eyes, but I ached bad, all over, and I fell off, until some <i class="calibre5">cavone</i> yells in my ear, ‘no sleeping on the benches…get your fucking ass out of here.’ I push myself up, still groggy, but ready to fight, and I see this animal of a dirt soldier, holding a rifle and starring holes through my head. He pushes me down. Now I am pissed, I talk tough. ‘Hands off if you know what’s good for you,’ that is what I said, and it is a fool thing to say to a man with a gun. But I did.” He smiled. “You know me. Short on good sense.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you pull it out?” Santo asked.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Pull it out?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. Your uncles pistol. Did you pull it out?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh, si, the pistol. My first thought. But I take a good look at the animal standing over me, the tip of a rifle barrel at my nose. I squinted. ‘I know this <i class="calibre5">cavone</i>,’ I say to myself. I rub my eyes. *<i class="calibre5">Natale Bucco</i>. We did time together; I mean we served in the army together, until he tells me he is deserting, he has had enough. He hated officers and taking orders. That night he makes a break for the fence and almost killed himself when he was caught in the wire, but he made it.”   </p>
<p id="page_347" class="calibre6">It made no sense.  A soldier who deserted, but still a soldier.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How is he a soldier if he deserted?” I asked, not doubting Luca, but his stories change with the wind. Maybe this Bucco only <i class="calibre5">talked </i>about deserting.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. He went over the hill and headed to his father’s farm in Calabria. He shoveled shit for a month, and came crawling back on hand and knees, pleading, ‘let me back in,’ he says to the big shot officers. I believe he missed his rifle and his uniform. In those days, he dressed better than an officer. Because he come back, and kissed ass. they give him only a month in the stockade. Now he is a ‘lifer.’ God love him. A fucking lifer. Last night we talked old times. But he had his rounds, so I go back to sleep. He promised to wake me up before the line formed at the ferry and he gives me three passes.” Luca stretches his right arm straight out. “We travel on the arm, for once. On the arm.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought about the three tickets I bought and the good money I pissed away </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Nessun rimborso. </i>No returns.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Anyway, he comes and wakes me up when the ticket office opened. We go to the ferry and he strong arms a few <i class="calibre5">cavones</i>(assoles) along the way. They give him a bad time, until he threatens to throw them off the docks. He brings me to the front and tells the first two in line, ‘military business…these spots are reserved for someone else.’ I am first in line, and you are two and three behind me.” I was angry at my friend, this sonofabitch.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why did you ignore us…would you leave use here?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca puts his hand on my shoulder; he looks me straight in the eye. “Antonino? When are you late? You are better than a clock. Bucco owed me and he come through for all of us.”   </p>
<p id="page_348" class="calibre6">“Owed you?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. I give him money for a meal, way back. He gambled it away, or drank it, or spent it on some whore, but he never paid me back. But today he is paid in full. We will be on the ferry. ‘<i class="calibre5">Gratis</i>.” Free. He waves us on, that is all it takes.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I ask, still thinking in my head, how is this possible?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are saying say the gate man will let us pass on this Bucco’s word. Even with these two cavones bitching we took their spots?” Luca nods.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. The fix. If they make trouble, he strong arms them and finds a reason to throw them off the dock….now we are the <i class="calibre5">pezzonovante…</i>the big shots. It feels good. You and Santo were two and three, as long as you showed.”  Santo was worried about the last two, a man and a woman, with no children, thank God.  Santo taps Luca’s shoulder to get his attention.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The last two in line? What about them?” Luca looked away.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Fuck them both. Tell them to come back another day. They would do it to us.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca yells to Bucco, who was standing at the ferry gate, and he walked our way. Luca was excited that we would meet this man, who carried a French rife.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Treat him right…he saved our asses.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Bucco walked with a swagger, like a German officer; how they throw back their shoulders to show authority, and I have seen Germans who came to our camp and ate with the Italian officers, who have <i class="calibre5">no</i> swagger, <i class="calibre5">no</i> style, <i class="calibre5">no</i> education(some do not read or write).  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Men were still loitering near the gate, but not close enough to piss off the soldiers and the Master. Bucco, angry face and all, came charging like a bull. The men in his path parted peacefully, as he passed through the middle; none complained, not one, or asked, ‘what about my family?’  </p>
<p id="page_349" class="calibre6">Lifers are angry man.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Meet *<i class="calibre5">Natale Bucco</i>,” Luca said, but corrected himself. “<i class="calibre5">Scusi</i>, I mean Corporal Natale Bucco. Look at him. He is almost a god damn officer.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Bucco sneers, spitting near Luca’s feet.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Officer? This is what I think of officers.” He spits again, splashing Santo’s right boot; to my surprise Bucco was embarrassed. He points to me and Santo.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who are these the two assoles,” he asks Luca, but looking straight at me. Luca nodded.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They <i class="calibre5">are </i>two assoles. You are correct. They said I abandoned them. Men I have known all my life.” Bucco spit again. “But they are my friends. Antonino Sparacino and his <i class="calibre5">cugino</i> Santo Sparacino.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Bucco stands back aways and looked us over, down to the strings on our boots. He nods, not a friendly nod, and shifts his rifle to the left hand. His stare was cold and violent, that caused me some concern. I knew men like Bucco. What they could do. What they wanted to do. He starts talking and telling stories, bullshitting on and on, about the old days in the army with Luca. About the women he knew that he could have and violate any time he wished, for a glass of cheap wine, or for nothing if they were drunk enough. Santo was red faced. The “if only” stories started. “If only” he had a lira for every bottle of grappa they drank together, Bucco and Luca, and threw up, they could be a great landowner today.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If only” the officers were not fools.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If only” the army was run right. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If only.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Good times,” Luca patted Bucco on the shoulder.  “When we come back through here, one day, me and my friends will be filthy rich. I might stop and say hello to you, if I am in the mood, and tip you for your help today, or you can come with us now.” <i class="calibre5">Uno scherzo</i>. A joke. It was funny. We laughed, except Bucco…Corporal Bucco, who said leaving Sicilia was the same as being a goddamned traitor, and he was no traitor. Luca shook his head.  </p>
<p id="page_350" class="calibre6">“Bullshit. Making your life better is what this life is about. Throw that relic of a rifle in the drink and come with us. Then you can brag no one goes over the hill like Bucco. All the way to America.” Bucco was thinking.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, I have done it before,” he said. “Gone over the hill. It is not for me. But for you, I say <i class="calibre5">buona fortuna. </i>In any case, may God be good to all of you, and a safe return when you come back…and you will come back…this is your home…and you will come back failures. I feel it in my bones.”  He snapped a sharp salute to Luca, who ignored him.  This angered Bucco, some. He grabbed Luca’s arm.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you pray, get on your knees. The only reason this ferry is leaving, is the twenty-five soldiers. If our fucking little colonel changes his mind, or the briganti move too far north, this ferry will be quarantined like the rest…mark my words.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then we swim,” Luca said. “But we go,” and to this we Santo and I agreed, like the foolish men we were.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Foolish men who could not swim the stream in <i class="calibre5">*Ponta’s</i> orchard.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca and Bucco embraced. “God speed,” Bucco said. <i class="calibre5">Arrivaderci Corporal Bucco</i>.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The guard opened the gate. Men grabbed their bags and suitcases and waited patiently for the line to move. Women counted their children. I could hear it and feel it, the horrible quiet and I was shitting my pants scarred all over again. We loaded first, being at the head of the line, and looked for good seats on the first deck, maybe aside a row of open windows. The two men we sent back in line, foolishly argued their place with some other guard, who swore to Christ he could not overrule Bucco, as the army was in charge until the ferry left the dock. This pissed off the two even more, and I smelled trouble coming. The wind kicked up, and the ferry, though tightly moored, heaved some and men and women grabbed onto anything to keep from falling. Santo went white, like a petcock opened and the all the blood was draining from his body. He gasped for air, recovering some, swearing if he could be by an open window he would not be so fearful of sinking and drowning, but when he used those words, ‘sinking and drowning,’ a dozen stopped and stared and a few turned white.  </p>
<p id="page_351" class="calibre6">There was a silence in the cabin.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Scusa,” he said. “I have not been on a boat before. The rocking. It makes me sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">An old man pushes Santo. “If you are sick, be sick someplace else.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The breeze from the bay was chilly, sometimes cold, but it moved the air and blew away the smell of fish, that only fisherman can tolerate, and love, or so they say. The two men we forced back in the line, sat behind us, trapped against the end wall; still pissed, as I could tell, for what reason I could not say. One mouthed these words under his breath; “you will pay,” or something like it. We will likely be with them on the train and the boat to America; this I knew like I know death is at the end of the line. We will certainly be in the same cabin, and I know this to be true because it can only be true. Knock out my teeth. Why wait? Do it while you are fresh and not tired and are able to make it fast.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Through the window I see the Corporal, Bucco himself, arguing with a man and his young woman, who I believe were ninety-nine and one hundred in line, who were now one-hundred and one and one hundred and two, and culled because we took two places not ours to have. Was I sorry for these two? I was. But I was not sorry we took their place. I am more like Castello than I wanted to believe.   </p>
<p id="page_352" class="calibre6">Deck hands were bringing on the last crates of ammunition and body bags, stuffing everything under seats where the soldiers sat. I was drawn to this young soldier, a boy,  clutching his rifle and sweating like a pig, and I thought, maybe, the body bag he guarded will be his own when it was all over. Would he kill, or be killed, or run? I felt for these boys, who were not men, but who would be the fighters, with a gun at their backs, but not the officers, who will not fight, but order the others to fight. <i class="calibre5">Fellino</i> says these boys are conscripts and will not fight. They run.  I hope he is right, and when they run, they run fast, and not in a straight line. And they run far away.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo said he was sick; worried he would throw up in front of men he did not know.  </p>
<p class="calibre7">“Hold your breath,” I said, and he did, but the shit comes up and drips down his chin. Not  much. He turned away and wiped, and I do not believe anyone saw it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Cavones,” I hear the two bitchers say, and they repeat it, so I knew they had not let the anger go. If there is a fight, it will be when we get off at Villa San Giovanni.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Cavones,” they kept saying, not loud enough for Luca to he sat calmly by an open window.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A fight, here and now, and our asses are in the sea.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo was a sick man, as I said; so nervous he shook, but from fear and nothing else.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am praying we do not sink,” he said out of nowhere, and a deck officer turned and stared him down. I give Santo an elbow to the ribs. He was jolted and he turned to me, starring like a child afraid of the dark.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Stai zitto</i>,” I said, and he was embarrassed. “No more talk like that.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si</i>, si. I understand” He leaned to me, complaining the ferry was a relic, and asked me to guarantee we would make it to Calabria in one piece, and not sink. The ferry was near junk, as I saw it, in bad need of repair. The paint peeled everywhere, down to the bare iron and cracked wood. I lost count of the broken windows and windows that had no glass. On the inside deck, the wood was cracked, and I see rot, not much, but too much for a boat in the water. In all I counted nineteen broken, or warped deck boards. It <i class="calibre5">was</i> a boat for its failings, and I suppose she had made this crossing a thousand times without sinking, or we would not be sitting in her bowels.  </p>
<p id="page_353" class="calibre6">I understood Santo and his fear, as drowning is one of my fears, like freezing and dark and dying and a hundred other things. I am not a coward, but it sounds like I am, but I am not. I have a nightmare where I drown in a foot of water when the footbridge over the stream collapses. A foot of water. In most of my nightmares, I see swollen streams and water flooding the streets. I drown in these dreams, but I have not had one for some time.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I turn away from Luca and Santo and made the sign of the cross.  I say to God’s mother,  “Allow this boat one more good trip, for the benefit of these suffering people.” This woman sees me, praying, and she smiles and nodded and made the sign of the cross. An old man trips on a split board that was lifted two or three inches off the deck, and he reached for something to grab, falling over a suitcase in the aisle, and landing hard on his knees. The owner of the suitcase, who was at least a fool for leaving it in such a spot, apologized, and offered his hand, but the old man grabbed the bench, and pulled himself up, his wrinkled face twisted in pain. Once up, he brushed his coat, apologizing for damage to the suitcase some fool left in the aisle. In the end he survived, except for a bloody nose, but he had them before, and they were of no concern to him, and his knees and legs were already gone. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Avanti, avanti</i>,” the deck officer yells, and whoever was standing took any seat and waited for the ferry to pull off the dock. Some of the children, five or six, cried, out of fear, I believe, but I was too old to cry. The engine idled smoothly, picked up revolutions, as it blew dirty smoke across the dock, and the stink of it and the stink of the fuel made me lightheaded; my stomach, uneasy and sour, gave off strange sounds, like Santo’s always does. I know olives and lemons and animals, but I do not know the sea, who is a bad woman and not to be trusted. Santo whispered again, that he was certain the ferry would sink, but not until we were in the deep water, leaving no chance to survive. Luca leaned back, cap pulled down, but not covering his eyes. He stared at the ceiling, tapping the fingers of his right hand on the windowsill. “Kick me when we get there,” he said, deciding he would sleep his way across the Strait, since there was reason to look at water, as he has seen water before. Plenty of water. A deck hand pushed open the heavy metal door, and it closed hard behind him, and the force shook the cabin walls. Two sailors worked the rusted chains, and the gangplank raised slowly off the dock. Some of the passengers moved to my side of the cabin for a better look, as they believed we were about to pull away. The ferry leaned and my stomach flipped over; Santo’s face was white because the blood was gone. Where did this blood go when it went? I have always wondered. He closed his eyes and squeezed my arm. “Are we sinking?” he asked. “Not yet,” I said. He wiped the sweat from his forehead, with the hand that shook, like an old man’s hand.       </p>
<p id="page_354" class="calibre6">For some reason the ferry leaned, and this worried me, some; how long before it flips on its side and slides to the bottom of the Strait? I was scared shitless. Too many people were in my face. “Get the hell away from me,” I wanted to say it but did not. <i class="calibre5">Cento venti-cinque</i>?  A hundred and twenty-five. The old ferry was fit for, maybe, fifty, or seventy-five, but not <i class="calibre5">cento venti-cinque</i>. We were packed tight, like animals in a pen, sardines in a can.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">There were twenty men, at least, left on the outside deck, shivering, and half again as many women and children. I should have pitied them, been sorry for them, but I had no feeling left, and that was that. I see this woman, with a pleasing look about her, bending the ear of a deck hand; her voice was low and weak, like all women, so I barely heard what she asked. I believe she asked on the train to Napoli. But where is her man? Did she have a man? I cranked my neck, hard, looking for her man, but she seemed to be alone. A woman alone is tragedy on this island, and in Calabria, I have heard. What do women know about trains?   </p>
<p id="page_355" class="calibre6">“Ask the Master at Villa San Giovanni,” I hear him say, showing little care and no respect, and she looked over the cabin to see if she was the center of it all.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have no information,” he said, as he turned away and ignored her, and this made her all the more nervous.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But I hear there has been trouble on the line,” she said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He yelled at two men who left their bags in the aisle. Not the two men we fought with, thank God.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ask the Master,” he said again, still short tempered, as two others waited for answers.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ask the Master?  What is ‘the Master?’ I do not understand.”  Now the deck hand starts to walk away from her. “The Master is the man with all the information.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I see it as the plain truth she was still confused, but in any case, she dragged her two ragged satchels down the aisle, but one caught on the underneath of a seat, and she struggled like hell to free it. Such an easy woman to watch, I thought. Maybe thirty-five years old, well kept, in fine shape for a <i class="calibre5">contadina</i>, if she <i class="calibre5">is</i> a peasant. The clothes on her back were not that shabby, but in need of some repair, mostly like the clothes peasant women wear. Yet she stood out, by her decent look and the fancy red hat on her head, that wore with pride, as she was always touching it, and this drew men’s eyes to her. And the small white plume in the band of it, that I had never seen a woman wear, or have I seen a peasant woman wear a red hat, with a plume, or any hat, or anything but a ragged kerchief, sometimes a shawl. Yes, I am correct.  Never a red hat and never a red hat with a white plume. Maybe I am wrong; maybe she is no <i class="calibre5">contadina,</i> but she does not talk with confidence, like a woman of means, or a woman who has married well. She sat still on the edge of a bench, straightening her hat that was crooked, when a high wave from an iron steamer caught her by surprise, jolting her to the floor. I was thrown by the same wave, against the man next to me, but I recovered and went to lend her a hand, but she was embarrassed and waved me away. She lay on the floor, all twisted, as every eye in the cabin was on her fine form.  Once she started to right herself, she kneeled for near a full minute, until she found the strength to get up on her own. She asked for no help, except I retrieved her hat that slid under the seat. She smiled and thanked me, while gently positioning it back on her head. She seemed so proud, and I was happy for her. She was not my conce.  She makes this trip with no man, so it is on her to accept the consequences. I hear bad stories about women who travel alone. Maybe she is desperate, with no way out except to take this chance. If she is desperate, she is <i class="calibre5">contadina</i>.  </p>
<p id="page_356" class="calibre6">I tapped the deck with my nervous foot, like a man with no sense in his head. I thought on things to help me pass the time; maybe this is a dream and mama will wake me to start the day. Or, maybe, I live in Francia, or Spangna, or someplace better, or America and I go to Sicily to visit <i class="calibre5">parenti</i>. I have not been in the army or worked for Castello and I come from people who own three, four hundred hectares of good land next to his, and we are friends and equals and my mother is godmother to his oldest grandchild. I slide around in my seat, settling to rest my eyes, waiting (I never believed we would make it to Calabria, because the ferry would sink).  The engine speeds up, and I feel vibrations rattling the floor. Then, and for no good reason, the engine stops, and we bounce in the bay, like a cork dropped in a barrel of water. What did it mean? It has happened, what we feared. There was panic in the cabin, as men rushed to the windows for a look, and the women grabbed their children. Another wake hits the ferry and people are thrown to the floor, but not the woman with the red hat, who held the back of her seat for dear life. She lives with the angels. She cannot be <i class="calibre5">contadina</i>.  </p>
<p id="page_357" class="calibre6">Out on the dock, two Carabinieri, tall and vigorous men, armed with rifle and bayonet, stood with the Master, who pointed at the ferry, nodding with the cops, on what they said. The goddamned government people have said we cannot leave the island. I knew in my gut this would happen. The bastards, the <i class="calibre5">pezzonovante</i> need labor to pick, or the briganti moved North and the soldiers are not needed, so there is no good reason to let us go on.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">That is what I thought, but I remembered I am never right, and I felt better.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A tall young man, a woman and two children at his side, cursed loudly, angrily.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They stopped us, goddamn their souls.” The woman took his arm, settling him some, but he was a man and men must be angry. He kicks the wall, cracking a plank, saying to the world he did not give a shit anymore. What did I feel? Nothing, right off. I should have been angry, pissed off for being pissed on. I pushed through to my seat, followed close by an old man, who asked if there was room for him, as his legs were tired and burning from the heat with bad circulation. In the rush to the windows, he lost his seat, and now he was lightheaded, worried he would faint, like a woman, in front of other men. I made room for him, and he took one step and collapsed like a bag of rocks.  He took my arm.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazie for your kindness. Men do not show courtesy and respect anymore.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I had no desire to speak, or carry on with a stranger, so I turn away.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Will we make it to Calabria?” he asked me. “I believe the Carabinieri have stopped us from leaving…what do you think?” I shrugged; this made him angry, and he leaned to me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But it’s a simple question. You must have some thought, some idea?”  </p>
<p id="page_358" class="calibre6">Only to rid myself of this nuisance, who would talk until my ear fell off, I say the first thing that came to me. “I am sorry, but I do not think about politics. I am a picker, paid to pick when there is a crop to pick. What do I know?” I hoped to leave it at that.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are contadino? Correct?  Farm labor. On your way to America.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded. “Si.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What great promises have they made to you?” He laughed and patted my knee, that did not concern me, as he was older than my grandfather, at least as old. Who would think anything else?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“All this,” he paused, gesturing with his hand. “This great movement of the people makes no sense to me. Who will plant the crops and harvest, if the contadini leave, and for no good reason?  What do you think?”  I cleared my throat but said nothing.  “Take it from an old man,” he said, “Our system has served us well for a thousand years, but now it is being upset by this foolish desire for something better…a better life. What does this mean, ‘a better life?’ You all say it. ‘A better life.’ What does it mean? A longer life? A healthier life? This confuses me.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I told you, signore, I am a picker. I pick. I have no interest in politics, or do I think about things like this.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He apologized. His ears were bad, he said, since he was no longer a young man, and his left ear is dead from a fight with a lazy worker, near thirty years ago.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But you agree?” He paused, as I said nothing. “But you must agree that the owners have the wealth and the breeding, but they are being cast to the wind. What will we do without these people? Who will protect these people? They must be protected, or we are lost.” He went on from there, but seemed confused, mumbling about criminals and briganti, but I ignored him, until he raised his voice.  </p>
<p id="page_359" class="calibre6">“My father said, and I believe this to be true. that a strong back comes from a weak mind.” He stares straight at me, without blinking. “I believe in our system,” he says. “The system makes sense to me. I will defend it until I die.”  I nodded and cleared my throat.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you enjoy things as they are, why are you leaving Sicilia?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He laughed, so that men around us looked, and a few made bad remarks.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ah, of course. I understand,” he said. “You think I am going with you make-believe adventurers to America…no, not at all. I go to Calabria to see my brother, who is sick, and I am afraid he will not last much longer. We have not talked much in thirty years, since our father cut him from the will. He was too soft, Papa said, too easy and would give money away. ‘Pay the workers more,’ he told papa, who goddamn near fainted. Anyway, I hope to see my brother one more time before he dies, to mend fences. But if they stop us,” he paused, “Well, I may never see him to make peace, but this is the price we pay for civilization. We were never that close. He was a, how do you say…a <i class="calibre5">sognatore</i>(dreamer). His feet in the clouds. Papa and me, we thought alike on everything important. Give nothing to nobody. Grind the last minute out of each day’s work. Papa was a great man. Men wept at his funeral. And you, who do you work for, when you are not leaving your country high and dry?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I felt in my pocket, for the jackknife I would used to stick his eye.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Who would see me in all this turmoil?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, you think the cops have stopped us?” I asked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. I believe so. When they finish arguing, they will throw us off the ferry. I have seen it done before.” He brushed both sleeves of his jacket, complaining Sicilia was too dirty for civilized men. Not like the north, Roma, Milano, and Firenze. Only civilized men in these places.   </p>
<p id="page_360" class="calibre6">“But all men want a better life,” I said. “Even landowners, the <i class="calibre5">pezzonovante</i>, who want it so much they take it away from me. You steal a better life by using the cops and politicians. I will get it with my feet.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ah, so you think.” He laughed. “Let me tell you the way of things in Sicilia. The crops rot when the peasants leave. Who will plant and harvest? The landowners, they are the innocent men…none of them are leaving, and they suffer because of wanderlust in men they have treated well. Maybe too good. The owner’s life, his wealth is invested in the land they own. They are the most important part, like wheels on a wagon.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You talk shit,” I said. “Like a landowner. Are you?” He stared hard at me, and when he finally spoke, he spoke loud, as if yapping orders in the fields.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you insult me, at least hear my name.” He stood up, about five feet tall, and brushed his sleeves, again. *<i class="calibre5">Andrea Micale</i>, from Milazzo, west of Messina. My father was Giuseppe, and my son is Giuseppe.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I refused to stand. “I am Antonino Sparacino, son of Orazio, from Ali, near Messina.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He was embarrassed I did not stand, and I suppose if I worked for him, I would be fired, or beaten by his overseer if there was a shortage of good labor. After a while he sat down and fumbled with the collar on his shirt. He scratched at his stubble (he needed a shave).  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Now what did you ask me? Si. If I owned land. No. Regrettably, not anymore, but I admit missing those great days.” He pointed at me, and his finger shook. “Oh, I still own a few hundred hectares for no other reason but not to be landless. What could be worse? What are you without land? But this is a young man’s business. I give most of my wealth and land to my first-born son; so far, he has turned two thousand hectares into four thousand, with more profits than I ever saw. Now, near every man in the village works for him.  Everyone. And he is respected. Sicilia is fortunate to have great men like my son, and.” He stood and pulled his coat tight. “And I say this proudly, not one of my family…either side…has fled to America, like criminals trying to escape the law.”    </p>
<p id="page_361" class="calibre6">I ignored his babble once he praised his son, who likely has not sweated from labor a day in his life and cheated everyone who ever worked for him. He talked about the great days and the great men he has known (Garibaldi, of course), so I settled back and waited for the Carribieneri to throw us off the ferry and we would make the long walk home, on sore legs and with empty pockets, with three worthless boat tickets hidden in the lining of my cap.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo. Nessun rimborso(No refunds).</i></p>
<p class="calibre6">Only two miles from Calabria, so close to breaking away. If I could get there, I would walk to Napoli, or maybe stow away when they tell me <i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo.</i> Or I would find work and buy a new ticket. Rich men have made this system for their own profit; brilliant men, but men who should be hated and who are hated. I will sit and wait and go home when I am told to leave, then I will plan and save, and come back another time., or if they want to stop me, they will  have to kill me, and they will if it serves them better.    </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo. Nessun rimborso(No refunds).</i></p>
<p class="calibre6">“They stopped us, goddamn their souls,” said this well-built young man; his wife cried.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought about my brother, Salvatore, who says I abandon our family. He said it a hundred times to my face in the week before I left, and refused to say goodbye, or walk with me to the top of the mountain road. He does not understand that what I do for me I do for us all. *<i class="calibre5">Franco Vitali</i> left here three years ago. Last year he called for his family, his wife, two sons and the young girl, Vittoria. He had a home waiting in America, and jobs for the boys and a school for the girl.  </p>
<p id="page_362" class="calibre6">Salvatore is strong, intelligent, but a child and children do not understand.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">They have stopped me for a time, but I will go on and get to America. </p>
<p class="calibre6">I swear this to God and my family.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I will sleep until I am thrown off this boat.    </p>
