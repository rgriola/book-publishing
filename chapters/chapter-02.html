  <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Visit and The Nurse (Present Day)</h3>
  <p>I watched him from the corner of my eye as he undid the buttons on the jacket we give him for Christmas, with the new ten-dollar bill in the left pocket, but I give him a dirty look when he throws this fine garment across the back of the chair, and it slips to the floor. He picked it up and brushed it off and hung it nicely on a wall hook, made for such things. This jacket was almost new when his grandmother found at the Salvation Army store, after he left his in the school yard and some sonofabitch of a thief took it home. He was afraid to tell his father, who forgets the foolish and reckless things he did as a young man.</p>

  <p>“<strong>Siediti.</strong> Sit down. Relax.” He was nervous, I see, this boy I love like I love myself and everything decent. “Grandpa, you look good,” he said. I believe he meant it, or I wanted him to mean it. “You say I look good? <strong>Tu sei pattzi?</strong> Are you crazy?” “No, I mean it. You look good. So, uh, when are you coming home?” “Home? You ask when I will be home? Well, if every…”</p>

  <p>Before half the words come out of my mouth, the door swings open, hard, like it was hit by a freight train, and she stood at the threshold, <strong>Signora O’Neil</strong>, the giant of a nurse, annoying, too tall for a woman. She is pushing her pill cart, noisy wheels and all, toward my bed, and it sounded like an old streetcar that had seen better days. The cartwheels wiggled as she struggled to push it in a straight line. The other nurses, the young ones, call her ‘the queen,’ **la regina**, when she is not around, and complain about each her faults and I have seen everyone. My pleasant day was over.</p>

  <p>“How are we today?” she says. “Any complaints this morning?” Complaints? <strong>Si.</strong> I have a thousand complaints. You are too loud for a woman; you have too many opinions and you are too tall. I call her “noise,” but only when she is not around, as it would be disrespectful to say this to her face, and educated woman like her. “It’s that time, Mr. **Sporkeeeeny**.” She smiled. “Temperature time. The easy way today. Isn’t that nice. We like the easy way, don’t we? Get ready to open wide.”</p>

  <p>She called me “Sporkeeeeny,” like my name had a hundred e’s. It does not offend me, but it annoys me. Michele, it offends. I look at his face, he is like a young bull seeing red, and, like his father, he could not keep his mouth shut. “Excuse me, ma’am.” She looked away from him, as she walked to the window and raised the shades, letting in dim light from the depressing winter day, but I prayed it would not be my last. “Sporkeeeeny, ma’am. You said ‘Sporkeeeeny.’ Our name is <strong>Sparacino</strong>. Simple to say.” She steps back from the window, and shakes her head, like she is disgusted at the world. “It’s like a morgue in here,” she says. “We need light to be healthy.” She turns toward Michele, hands on her hips, like a cop, and looks him straight in the eyes. “And you, young man? You complained about a name?”</p>

  <p>“Our name is Sparacino, ma’am. You said ‘Sporkeeny,” and I don’t think ‘Sporkeeny’ is a name.” She stared at him and nodded slowly. “Hmm. Not a name, you say. Well, then, I am sorry,” her apology more like a joke. “But I believe ‘Sporkeeeeny’ is the name on my chart. I would gladly show it to you, but I left it at the nurse’s station. Anyway, there are so many…well, names to remember. I am confused by all of them.” She walks to the night table and arranges things to her satisfaction; water glass here, pill bottle there, and the dirty washcloth she took away. “There,” she said, stepping back, happy and content. She turns to Michele. “Names? You mentioned names. Who can keep them straight? I know Eyetalian (Italian) names end in a vowel, don’t they? But isn’t ‘y’ a vowel? I remember it from school. The vowels. A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y.”</p>

  <p>“It’s Sparacino, ma’am. S-p-a-r-a-c-i-n-o.” She tapped her right foot on the floor. “Yes, I know, you have said it. And now you have spelled it. Thank you. But excuse me, I have rounds to finish.” She went on about her business, firstly smoothing my bed, tucking the loose ends under the mattress. She raised my head, gently, I admit, and changed the pillowcase to a clean one, she brought from the closet. She has good hands; delicate for a big woman, and she makes a fine bed. A good quality in a woman. I need her. I cannot piss her off. What do I have left but a little bit of comfort?</p>

  <p>“There, it’s done,” she said, fanning herself with the white cloth she carried across her right shoulder, and complained three nurses called in sick, so she was stuck to do most of the work with their patients and her own. “Stuck. Well, I don’t mean stuck. But am I a machine? Sometimes I feel like a machine.” Was she talking to me? If she was, what do I say? How do I answer her complaints? She dropped onto the easy chair that set in the corner and grunted. “Just for a minute,” she said, although she looked guilty, as I suppose she was breaking some rule, maybe a nurse’s law. She groaned. Her legs were tired and sore, and the day had just begun. She pushed off her shoes, one at a time and they dropped to the floor. She rubbed her ankles that seemed to be swollen. “That feels good,” she says, in a quiet voice. I do not believe she intended we hear the pleasure she felt, but her voice carried from the corner of the room.</p>

  <p>“Our breaks should be longer,” she said, looking straight at me, as if I could change the rules and if I had this power, why would I pay the bill? “These doctors think they are privileged people, coming and going as they please, and they make all the money, and we do all the work.” Her long legs were not crossed, and I see more than I am used to seeing on a woman who was not my wife. I add to her many faults the sin of poor modesty, if there is such a sin. I watch her rubbing her feet and legs and could not look away, and she catches me and smiled, but maybe it was the way her head was turned, and the way the light hit her face and hair. If I did look, it was only a peak. If this is the worst I have ever done, hell should be no fear of mine.</p>

  <p>She settles back in the chair and cleared her throat. “This talk about names reminds me of one of my mother’s borders, from years ago. A little Eyetalian (Italian) man. Worked the railroad, and maybe, he spoke ten words of English, bad English; me and my sister laughed whenever we heard him trying to talk, but I guess you don’t have to be a genius.” She leaned to make her point. “Ten words of English…ten words, that’s all he could speak, and they made him a citizen. Do you believe it? You should be fluent in the language or go home. Don’t you think so, Mr. Sporkeeeeny? God only knows what some of them are saying. And the way they look at you. What are they thinking? You never know what they are thinking. Other women have said it…not just me.” She closed the collar on her white shirt and for some reason I looked away. Too many foreigners, she says, but I hear this talk on McCarthy Street, near the park, and the Americani say the country is going to hell. They scream it in my ear, and I have always wanted to scream back, and someday I will. “This is not your country,” they tell me, and I swear by the grace of God, if I leave here, walking, I will grab the first sonofabitch on McCarthy Street by the neck and scream in their ear, **va' fa' un culo**.</p>

  <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">

  <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Immigrant's Life: The Railroad and Race (Past)</h3>

  <p>She was still talking, complaining about this and that; breaks; nurse’s breaks, doctors breaks, and sick time, vacation time, the English language, and the whole world should speak English and it would be a better place; her mother, this and that and finally, the immigrants. Some people, she says, but not her, say we have ruined the country because we do not “fit in.” But she does not hate us, her mother once rented to an immigrant. But then, like a wind from nowhere, her boss, The **capu di tutti capi** shows and stands at the threshold, arms folded against her chest, like a railroad bull checking freight cars for bums, for no reason but to club heads, or drop a few in the ditch. Where is this woman’s bell? She should wear a bell, like a cow wears a bell. It should be the law. No warning. She just showed, like a ghost. It is the god damned rubber soles they wear.</p>

  <p>“Excuse me, Mrs. O’Neil,” she says, loud and nasty (I am wrong. She is worse than a bull.) “I don’t mean to interrupt your leisure time.” The big nurse jumps from the chair and stands at attention and clears her throat. “Oh, no. Of course not. I just, uh, felt lightheaded. Faint. You know. But I’m fine. Nothing to worry about.” “It’s nice to see you made a quick recovery, Mrs. O’Neil. And your shoes. Please.” Lightheaded? Faint? She lies to the boss. Is that so bad? Who did she kill? “You are aware, Mrs. O’Neil, we are covering two floors today. There is no time to lounge.” She looks at the watch pinned to her uniform. “Your break is not for another hour. Please get on with your rounds.” She looks down. “And your shoes. Please, put them on. Have respect for your patient.”</p>

  <p>I keep my mouth shut. I look around the room and act like I hear nothing, but I see that Signora O’Neil is red in the face, and I know the <strong>Irlandese</strong> (Irish) fight for no reason. I see this on the railroad. They fight over the time of day. Me? I do not enjoy violence, or watching violence, but I have never seen two women fight, so, I admit being a little curious. The boss nurse takes a few more steps into the room. “You should apologize to Mr. Spor….” She looks at her clipboard. “Mr. Sporceeo. You should apologize to Mr. Sporceeo.” “<strong>Non e importante</strong>,” (it is not important), I say. “She is a fine nurse.”</p>

  <p>The **capu** writes on her clipboard, and when she’s finished, she taps at the paper with the tip of the pencil. “There,” she said; a strong “there,” and she goes off down the hall, saying no more. I was sorry for her, Mrs. O’Neil, that she was called out in front of me, and embarrassed, but she never apologized as she was ordered to do, but I was glad she did not, as any man expecting an apology from a woman is not much of a man. She goes to the door and kicks at the stopper, and the door closes hard. She hurried through the room moving things in her way; the table, a chair, and she stops at the window and pulled down the shades and the room went dark. She closed the curtains, changed her mind; opened them and rolled up the shades. She turned, still embarrassed and I believed, in her mind, I was the fault of it.</p>

  <p>She said and stared at the ceiling, “What was I saying? I remember. I was saying my mother was a fine and friendly woman, always talking to her tenants, especially the little the immigrant man I was speaking of. It was comical to see them together. All he ever said was “me no cabitee,” or something like that. Mama was always repeating herself, poor thing. I felt so sorry for her. I remember one day I just said, ‘throw him out,’ but she needed the money and he always paid on time( if they weren’t drunks, they always paid on time.) But I didn’t trust him at all, or his wife and his children. Cramped together, all living in one room, like animals. His name, uh, was ‘Biacho,’ or ‘Binnani,’ something like that. It ended in a vowel; I know that much.” She stares at me. “And did mama ever complain about the smell? Never. She was a fine Christian. Me? I would have asked him to leave. Money or no money.” She shakes her head. “I never, I mean never, heard him speak more than two words of English.” She straightens a picture on the wall. “What a horrible painting…anyway, they let them be citizens. They let them vote. Can you believe it? But they made him change his name to ‘White.’ A good name, don’t you think? ‘White.’ Helped him fit in. You know, be one of us. Isn’t that why he was here? I don’t know about his wife, or his kids.”</p>

  <p>I nod. <strong>Si</strong>, of course. He changed his name. He was a fine man. She smiled. “White? It’s a good name, right?” White? <strong>Si.</strong> A very good name. I knew many ‘Whites’ in Sicilia. They fit in good. “What’s in a name, anyway?” she says, as she passed my bed. I did not understand her question. “What is in a name? You are asking me this?” She laughed. “No, no. It’s an American saying. You’ve heard it before.” “Si, uh, yes, of course. Who has not heard it? I forget, that’s all.” Then I apologize to her. “The pills…they are confusing me.” “Of course, you poor thing. Anyway, enough chatting.” She looks at the door. “Back to work before she has a fit. She’s a testy woman these days. Its **Miss Herbert**, you know. Miss Herbert.” She whispers, “No husband, poor thing. Very lonely, I think, although she has not said it to me. She might try losing a few pounds…but who am I to say? I suppose she will marry a doctor and retire…they all do, these young nurses.”</p>

  <p>Michele is standing, his back against the wall, listening and watching. She comes to the side of my bed. “Open your mouth. Say ‘ahhh.’” “Ahhh.” “Again.” “Ahhh.” “Let’s see. Hmnn. A little red.” She picks a thermometer from her tray and points it to the light, complaining on the numbers; too small to read without squinting, and it makes her eyes sore and her head throb. She stares at me. “Why do they make these numbers so small?” I shrug. “Open wide.,” she said; but harsh, like an order, and I did it. I always feared biting through the glass and swallowing the shit they put in the tubes. She hummed and tapped her foot. She counts to thirty and pulls it out. “Hmnn. A little high.” She drew the thermometer close to her left eye and shook it hard. Michele was quiet, out of the way, but he comes to my bed and asks a question. “How high?” He was meek, like a little boy. Meek. I barely hear him ask. “I’m sorry, young man, but I cannot give that information. Ask the doctor. I’m only the nurse. He will tell you if he thinks you should know.” She opens her clipboard and writes down this secret number she could not say, hiding it in the curve of her hand when she catches Michele looking over her shoulder. Clipboards? Cavones who have them are not worth a shit for anything. “When will you let my grandfather go home?” he asked, politely. She stares away. “When will I let your grandfather go home…is that what you asked?” He nodded. “Home?” She thought. “I don’t make these decisions. See the doctor. It’s up to him.”</p>

  <p>She turned away and shuffled through the bottles on her pill cart; six green glass bottles; two rows, three bottles to a row. The pills were different colors, different shapes and sizes from yesterday. I hope there is no mistake, but I refuse to ask and give her the satisfaction of knowing I am nervous about it all. She hands me a glass of water from the nightstand; stale water, I believe, as I recall it set there two days, or better, but I could be wrong. Michele asked her, was it “good water,” but I wave him back. I took the pills with the water she offered, and it was not so bad. Stale water is as wet as fresh water. I live by a single code, and it has served me well. Never cause yourself trouble, or cause another man trouble, so that he wants to cause you trouble, and never see anything you are not supposed to see, even if you see it, and if you see it and somebody knows you saw it, it is always best to lie about it. This I learned from my grandfather. “Good job, Mr. Sporkeeny...now try to rest,” and I did like she said. Michele clears his throat, loud enough for her to hear and he waits. She heard it, I know, but ignored him; he clears his throat again, louder and she turns. “Do you want something?” she asks, all annoyed, as I could tell. She steps back and stares over the top of her glasses, that had gold frames. She was no attractive woman, in my opinion. “Our name is Sparacino, ma’am. Not ‘Sporkeeny.’ You mock our name.” He pissed her off, good, and she comes back at him. “Are you his son? Are you Mister Mr. Sporkeeeeny’s…” “I am his grandson, ma’am, <strong>Michael Sparacino</strong>.”</p>

  <p>She looks at her watch. “Visiting hours are almost over. Ten minutes, no more.” “I would like to stay longer. I have not seen my grandfather in a while?” She shook her head and curled her lip, that she did often. “I am sorry, young man. If I break the rules for you, then I must break the rules for everyone.” She looks him straight in the eyes and he turns away. “Isn’t that right?” She tells him, more an order, that he must leave the minute visiting hours are over, or he would deal with the head nurse. “And let me warn you about this woman.” She lowered her voice. “Men have a name for her.” She smiles, and I wonder the word. “She will call security without a second thought. Even the police if you refuse to leave. We can’t have visitors making their own rules, now can we. Comeback tomorrow.” She played with the bottles on her pill cart, and arranged them to her liking, and when finished with this chore she left; no ‘goodbye,’ or other such pleasantry. “Good riddance,” I said, as she disappears through the door. “And stay away unless you are called.” I said this in a whisper, like a gentleman, and truthfully, I hoped she did not hear me. It is not what you think that I am a coward, or afraid of this mouthy woman, but I am a child and she is the mother. I need her.</p>

  <p>I ask Michele, “do you think I am afraid of her?” He shook his head. “No one thinks you are afraid, grandpa. You’re not afraid of anyone.” I lifted my hand from the bed and waved him, come over to me. “<strong>Michele…vienne ca.</strong> Sit down.” He sat, nervous; his legs shook, hard, and he played with his woolen cap, that he finally folds in half and holds tight in his lap. “You will never be a fool,” I said, taking his hand, that was big and broad, for a young boy. His grandfather’s hands. “How about pitch, if you brought the cards? But never tell your mother.” He smiled. “Never. I know your rules. I am your grandson.”</p>

  <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Will and The Lawyers (Internal Monologue)</h3>

  <p>I want to leave him something when I am gone, so he will remember me when he is an old man, and he will say good things when his children ask about their great-grandfather, if they ever do. If we were in the old country, maybe I would pass on to him a shovel, or an old mule, or a barrel of wine. If he was lucky, I would have a little land to leave him, mostly rocks, but still, he would be a landowner. Here, **qua**, the young want money, as they have little feeling for land. What do I have, but a small house with a loan on it, and what little money I had was used to pay the doctors and the hospital? The lot sitting under the house is mostly weeds and rocks, too close to the tracks and the house shakes when a fast train runs by. Five children to raise took my pay every week, and now and then, over the years, I give my children a loan, never asking for payment. My father would have done the same thing if he had a lira to his name, but he did not, and was still a generous man. The few dollars I have is locked up, safe, in the <strong>First Trust Bank</strong>, across the tracks (the good part of town). <strong>Signore Fix</strong> is the Manager, maybe the owner; he promises to guard my money with his life. When I go in the bank, he shakes my hand and asks, “Your family? Are they good?” When Michele was seven or eight, Signore Fix promised him a job shining pennies when he is older. Michele believed him and often asked about the job, until he started earning money delivering newspapers, and never again.</p>

  <p>‘I you want to leave your grandson something, find a lawyer you can trust and make a will.’ they all say. <strong>Enrico Carlucci</strong> was a runner for the bookies, but an honest man. “See <strong>Antonio Martino</strong>,” he says. He saved my guilty brother from jail. It makes no difference to Martino, but he charges more for guilty.” Carlucci warns me this lawyer is no Siciliano, like us, but from **Caserta**, near **Napoli**. Napoli? Then he is **Napolitano**. Si, Carlucci says. Napolitano, but he has no horns. Napolitano? Not good, I think. My dead grandfather whispered in my ear, reminding me men from Napoli are all thieves and liars, and he knew this to be true, it was no rumor, as he worked the farms in **Scafata** when a young man. He was cheated bad and beaten by the overseers, because he was Sicilianu, and for no other reason.</p>

  <p>Instead, my son calls <strong>Corado Tipane</strong>, a Siciliano lawyer, but his wife wept on the phone, that her husband is sick, dying from bad lungs. He was a child when he worked in the sulphur mines, back in Sicilia,” she says. “But if you need a lawyer, be sure he is one of us, or at least **Calabrese**, who would be better than any man from Napoli. This is what my precious husband says.” Orazio asks about **Enrico Martino**, a Siciliano, who made a will for his in-laws. “Si, he is decent my husband says, but ambitious,” she warned Orazio. “And watch his bills. He is not from Napoli, but his mother is.”</p>

  <p>What do honest men know about lawyers? We call this Martino. “Come over when you can,” he says. “I always have time for my people.” He was not ‘**cento per cento**’, a hundred percent, but I was disparate, so I go holding my nose. I see this tiny shit of a man (I thought lawyers were all tall men) but he listened for ten minutes straight, chin resting on his left hand, a cigarette in his right. He rolled his own, he claimed, to save a few cents, and he passes this savings to his cliente, and better, he never blew the god damned smoke in my face, for which I was grateful. “Si, si, Signore Sparacino. You need a **volantà**…a ‘will,’ like the Americans say...to set things right before you are, uh…gone.” “Gone?” I ask. He looks at me and nods. “Gone…it will happen to all men, good or bad. A volantà is worthless until you are…” “**Morte**? Dead? I understand.” “But, of course, in **cento anni**, a hundred years.” “Can you do this work for me?” I ask. “Si, of course. Tell me what you have and what you want to do with it.” I hand him a piece of paper. He reads it; he smiles and snaps his fingers. “Come back in a week and this job will be done.” “**Quanto costa?** How much?” I asked. He stares away, through the open window. “Not much. A few hours’ work, maybe a little more, but I cannot quote you now. The phone is ringing.” I heard nothing. <strong>Fidati di me</strong>, he says. Trust me. Now I worry. I think, my God, I am trusting this man who was suckled by a woman from Napoli. But I was desperate; how much can he charge for a few hours’ work, like he says? Two hours of his life. They pay me sixty-six cents for two hours of my life. Does he see a fish? Maybe he will ask ten dollars, fifteen at the most. Ten dollars is robbery; he is a bandit, like all the Napolatani. But they say he is the best (he says he is the best). I will bring fifteen when I come, twenty to be safe. How could it be twenty? I work all week for twenty.</p>

  <p>I come back in a week, like he said, “Nice to see you,” he says, but did he look me in the eyes? “<strong>Siediti.</strong> Have a seat. Your papers are ready,” and he hands me his bill, saying he must answer the phone, but I heard no ringing. I see the numbers on his bill and near collapse. ‘$30,’ I see the figure and near collapse. Thirty dollars for a few hours’ work (two weeks’ pay for me). I ask, “why so much…two pieces of paper…one half empty…I am Sparacino, no Rockefeller?” He pushes back in his fine leather chair and poured himself wine, white wine, in a tall glass. White wine is for **il pomeriggio**, the afternoon, if it is ever for a man. Did I want wine, he asked? His best. Or maybe I would I enjoy a fine cigar, from Cuba, still fresh in the wrapper? He said he knew the Cuban boss, **Bapista**, like the back of his hand. “I did work for him some years back, and now he sends me cigars. We are like friends. Brothers.” He shows me the back of his hand and I nod. He is a bullshitter. “No, <strong>grazie</strong>. No cigar,” I said right off, not wasting a second to think. I feared he would charge me for the wine, the cigar, the time it took to take it out of the wrapper, and for the honor of being in the room with a man who knows the man who runs Cuba.</p>

  <p>“Are you questioning the bill, **pisano**,” he said. “‘Why so much,’ you ask.” He tapped his fingers on the armrest of his fine leather chair. “Sit down and I will tell you the ways of the world, and you will feel better about this bill, that is certainly reasonable. Wine? Or did I ask?” He leaned and patted my arm and smiled. “Why so much? you ask. Let me tell you.” He coughs and complains his chest is sore, and maybe he is dying, but he laughs, he has never felt better. “I am stuck here, in this foul office. Trapped by duty to my fine clients, like you.” He sniffs the wine, like a dog, then sips it, and there was this look of pleasure on his face. “In truth, signore Sparacino, I live to serve men like you, from the old country, as we are all hunted by the unscrupulous **americani**, who would steal every dollar we have.” He starred through the open window, almost in a trance; how good the fresh breeze felt on his face, he said, breathing in deep, letting it out slow. “I will be honest with you, Signore Sparacino. I think you complain about the bill because I am Napolitano, from my blessed mother. But I have earned this money as much as you earn your money. My father brought his family to America when I was twelve. **Dodici anni**. He sent me to the American school, not able to speak a word of English, then their law school, where I was an outcast. And yes, as you can see, I have prospered, and I have prospered because I protect the **Italiani**…all Italiani, from these Americans who will cheat us if they are able and take advantage of men who do not speak their language or understand their customs. I am here to serve you, signore Sparacino, not the Americani.” He blew rings of cigar smoke in the air; tricks, like I see from the drunks who drink in the tavern on Yates (**Mio Dio**, less than a block from the church).</p>

  <p>This tiny little man looks at me from the corner of his eye, and me him, and the corners of our eyes meet. He tightens the knot on his black tie, an undertaker’s tie, and smoothed the sleeves of his white shirt. “Why did you come to me if you do not trust me? You people have a full Siciliano lawyer…Signore Corado Tipani. A good lawyer, <strong>si</strong>, but his English is poor. He confuses the judge. He is getting on, I know. Still a fine lawyer but flawed.” “Flawed?” I did not know the word. “What is it ‘flawed?’” “Flawed. **Difettoso**.” “Difettoso. Si. I understand. Tipani is sick, bad shape. He will not be in business anymore. La moglie said you are a good lawyer, and not americano.” He threw back his head and sucked hard on his cigar. “Ah. I see why you are here. You were referred to me…but I cannot share my fee with his wife. Did she ask?” He passed me the papers in a brown envelope, covered in writing. I folded the envelope and shoved it in my back pocket. “Thirty dollars, **per favore**,” he said. “**Trenta dollari**.”</p>

  <p>I nod politely and open my wallet. Thirty was robbery, but I had twenty; it was all he would get, in dollar bills that I counted out on his desk. **Uno. Due. Tre**… At twenty I look up at him. “This is all I have. I am good for the rest. **Fidati di me**. You can trust me.” For a full Sicilianu lawyer, maybe I would pay thirty, then bitch for a month I was overcharged and cheated. But not for a Napolitano. Not for a house and a car and a vineyard. Not thirty dollars. I repeat to him, “I only have **venti dollari**, but I am good for the ten.” He got up from his fine chair, ready for an argument. As I hurry to the door, I say to him, “you will see me soon.” I walk extra fast to the street and the last I see him he was on the stoop, waving, yelling to me, like a crazy man. “Signore Sparacino…signore Sparacino…**torna qua…i dieci dollari**.” **Pazzo in testa**. “Come back…you owe me ten more dollars.” He said it five or six times, until I was far enough away his voice would not carry. The ten dollars? I never went back, or paid him, but I admit this, the little half-Napolitano lawyer did good work, and the pages were typed, neat and clean. But there is not thirty dollars of good work in the whole world. When I give the papers to **Orazio**, I make him promise he will take care of these papers, no matter. He promised, hand to God and I felt good, almost ready for what was to come next.</p>

  <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Final Days: Guilt, Death, and Goodbye</h3>

  <p>Carmela, my wife, will have the house; with the small railroad pension and the Social Security, she will make ends meet. The children will help. She never worked for pay until the children were gone, then she worked for **Dominick Angeloro**, the butcher, and his wife, **Assunta Piazzi**. I bitched about this job, but did she listen? I was sorry for her when the shop closed, put out of business by a chain that sold cheaper (and sometimes better, I admit). Carmela vowed she will never be a burden to her children. The house is paid up. Sixty-four dollars, fifty-nine cents a month for twenty years. I made the down payment, two hundred, from a card game when **Vito Bacci**, a small-time hoodlum, warned me, if I won another hand, it would be my last hand. His brother, **Angelo**, was the strong arm, but Angelo was in the pen for a year, and I was not worried. Thank God, I hid enough money to pay the taxes for a year, another two hundred, and the rest will help with food and lights, maybe a new dress or hat. She deserves it, and more. What did I ever give her? If she lives long after I am gone, or should the money run out, or she gives too much to one or two of her children, who will take advantage, then Orazio will see she is taken care of, like I promised at the overlook in Sicilia, on one of the Sundays I was invited to dinner. The union will bury me, so they said when I put my ‘x’ on the membership card. I will still owe ten dollars to Martino, the lawyer; bury it with me, I tell Orazio. If this **cavone** wants it, tell him where I am, and he can dig it up. I leave Michele my railroad watch, with the broken fob, and scratches on the glass, but it keeps good time. I hope he will value it, as there is nothing else, maybe good memories of me he can pass on to his children. I have no more to say on this.</p>

  <p>**Amaria**. She is working tonight. I see her in the hallway, passing my open door, and each time she smiled at me. I am an old fool, but she is “**luce del sole**,” like sunshine, and who does not enjoy sunshine? I ask the nurse, “am I on Amaria’s list today,” and the nurse, who was new, said she did not know Amaria, but there was a young girl on dinner duty. After a while she came and greeted me; like always, in **Italiano**, and when she was with me, I was not here, but home, in the piazza, enjoying the sun. “**Buonasera, signor Sparacino**,” she said, in a voice more music than Caruso. She wheeled her tray to the side of my bed, this beautiful young girl, and I admit, once more, that I am an old fool, but she smelled fresh and clean, like breeze off the ocean. “**Ha na faccia d’ancilu**,” her face is like an angel’s face, and I have come to know her as gentle, like a woman should be. She unfolds the napkin from my tray, and lays it across my lap, after I struggle to sit up. She tries to help, but no, and I wave her away. If I asked, she would feed me and be glad to do it. **Le palle**. Balls. I have none anymore.</p>

  <p>She smiles. “The food. It looks good tonight. Not like last night. You didn’t eat a thing.” I look close at the tray. Does she see what I see? Something, but not food. A kind of meat; raw, swimming in blood on the plate. Am I a dog? A scoop, a clump; cold rice, like cement…and something else…what is it? It must be food, or would they put it on the plate? Cold coffee in a cup with a cracked handle. Where is Carmela’s macaroni, with the meat sauce, and **Angelo Puliotto’s** sausage, or a dish of green olives, warm, so not to hurt my teeth and a bottle of wine; my wine, not the piss water **Ruffolo** sells in the back room, and calls it **vino fatto in casa**, homemade wine. My ass. He buys it by the barrel from pollacks on the east side. Is this too much for a man dying to ask? Dying. I said it. I have the cold sweats. My stomach aches. She looks at the tray. “I apologize for the food,” she says. Embarrassed, I believe. “Soon you will be home, enjoying your wife’s good Sicilian cooking.” “**Diu vi benedica**,” God bless you, I said; she smiled and rubbed my arm. Is she to blame they make her serve dog food to a human being? What is the pay for her shame? Nothing. Even Castello, the sonofabitch, paid more for picking beans, than nothing. May he rot in hell.</p>

  <p>“**Cognome**,” I ask. “Your last name?” “Trillo,” she said. ‘**Amaria Trillo**.” “Your father’s name?” “Giovanni. Giovanni Trillo.” Her family is from **Bocali**, in **Calabria**; I was there in the Army, even then it was near deserted. Such a foul place to live, I said. “Has it improved in fifty years?” I made a bad joke the day I met this fine girl. “You are Calabrese, but how is that your fault?” I insulted her people, I admit this, but she said no, not worry about it. What do I have against these people, the Calabrese? **Niente**. Nothing. I have known good Calabrese. Not many. A few. I do not like their wine; so thin and weak, like piss water. “**Buonasera, signore Sparacino**,” she said as she left. “I hope you sleep better tonight…I will say a prayer for you. Would you like that?” “Si, I would like it, for what good it will do.” She smiled and rubbed my shoulder. If I was twenty, maybe thirty years younger. What an old fool. Even twenty years younger, you are still her grandfather. “Your face is red, **signore Sparacino**.” She laughed and walked to the door, like a fine and cultured woman would walk. How could I look away? Her youth and her beauty, and the graceful way she moved and carried herself across the room. I am no evil man, and I had no desire for her, or use for her(not like that), other than the memories she brought to me. She smiles pleasantly at Michele when she passed. “Hello,” she said to him, but he looks toward the floor. “You are **signore Sparacino’s** grandson?” My God, he ignored her. Not so much as a nod of the head. Young women say hello to young men when they are interested in the young man, and for no other reason. There is no ‘polite’ in it. What man ignores a beautiful woman who says hello? “Michele…are you awake?” “Huh, grandpa. Did you say something?” “Si. Did you see her? Did you hear her? **Comѐ bella**, no? She is beautiful.” “Who?” He looks around the room. “Oh. Her. Yea, I saw her. She’s all right, I guess.” “All right?” “I wasn’t paying attention. Sorry, grandpa.” How can this be? If you do not see her, then you smell her as she walks by. She is a flower, a rose; no, a bouquet of roses. You always know when there is a bouquet of roses in the room. Is Michele a…how can I say this, or think this? Is he **finocchi**? Should I see it before? Of course. He is quiet and gentle, like a woman; but he gambles, he plays cards and baseball and runs miles for fun. Finocchi? I cannot believe it. He would grow flowers and sing, not gamble and run. I am a fool. His father would not allow it. These goddammed pills. I put it out of my mind.</p>

  <p>Amaria Trillo. She brings these memories to me, of a beautiful woman I met **cento anni fa**; it now seems a hundred years ago. She was a beauty, like this young girl, but better, a woman; the mother of two fine children. Her husband, as I knew, was a fine man, a good tailor, well respected in his village. I forget his name, or what he looked like, or the sound of his voice; but not her, or her look, or the scent of the powder she wore, as it drew me to her the first time we met. No. She was more than beautiful; a caring woman, who felt the suffering of others, like it was her own suffering, when most people do not. For years after I saw her the last time, on the celebration of the day I landed in America, I lit a candle and said a prayer, that she was safe and in good health, and her children prospered. I hope she is still alive, enjoying a good life and not alone. If she is alive, I would like to know before I die.</p>

  <p>Michele jokes about the empty bed in my room, that he is tired and should take a nap. I have asked when they will fill the bed. Orazio has asked, and they say ‘soon.’ Am I lonely when I am alone? **Si**. Yes. Alone is being dead, but it is a private thing, and I will say no more about it. Never tell any man your business or what you feel. Women always say what they feel, and in that they talk too much. When they wheeled me to this room, there was **Signuri Blanchard** was in the other bed. I know I disturbed his peace, but he was a polite and civilized man, swearing he was not bothered. The nurses say he was alone for a month after the old man in my bed dropped dead on the toilet. I was in better shape when Orazio brought me here, but I came with a cane, “just in case.” I was embarrassed, for what it told the world, and me, that I was old and weak, after years of a vigorous life. The nurse demanded I sit in a wheelchair, like a goddamned cripple. I say to her a good man is a man who walks when he can ride, but he should not be forced to ride, if he can walk. “Sorry. The rules,” she says, slipping the wheelchair behind, ordering me to sit. “For your own good,” she says. The old nurses never smile. I listen to her bullshit and nod politely, and right off I see she will not change her mind. I sat, weak and powerless, like some goddamned **cavone** and she pushes me down the hall, past two men talking and stop when they see me and stare with pity. She leans and pushes open the door to this room. “How are we today?” she says. I thought she was talking to the air, as I saw no one. I see the covers on the bed near the window, move and a face, half covered, staring me down. A colored face. Who warned me? No one. Who asked, will you share a room with a colored man? Is it all right with you? He was old and seemed harmless. When the shock wore off, I think, “you have worked with these people before. They know their place, and none of them have done you harm.” But my son is a hothead, a fighter, who does not give an inch (except to his wife) but he has no respect for colored men. He complains to the nurse, his father was picked for this insult, and no one asked, “will you share a room with a colored man?” A simple question that should have been asked out of respect. His complaint, he said, was not the color of the man’s skin (it was, I believe) but the room would be filled when his family comes to visit, and they would be loud and light-fingered and steal, and they smoke, and there are too many of them. “**Stai zitto**, Orazio,” I say. “What do I have for these people to steal?” “It’s not right, papa,” he says. “Not right.”</p>

  <p>The first night in the room, everything made a noise and I struggled to sleep. “Run,” is all I could say to myself. “Find a place you will be safe while you can still run.” The morning after the first night, the nurse came in and raised the shades, and things looked better in the day light. The colored man spoke firs; sorry he kept me awake, but the pills they give do not stop the pain, so he prays out loud just to hear his own voice and be closer to God. “Prayer has great power,” he said, “But it has not stopped this pain, or made me stronger. I am starting to doubt, and for that I am sorry.” “Did they tell you your condition?” I asked. “They are men of few words. They just say, ‘not very good.’” The doctor never sees him, but he is kept clean, most of the time, and they give him medicine and he is thankful as it could be worse. He prayed mostly in the night because he could not sleep, and he would ask God “why?” and one night came his answer, that saving him was not part of the **Plan**. He told me in the morning about The Plan, and I wondered what it meant, as he seemed a man of faith, worthy of better treatment, Plan or not. ‘**Amos**,’ his first name, was from the bible, he said. His father was a preacher in **Georgia**, and Amos was his favorite prophet. **Signuri Amos Blanchard** was older than me, maybe ten years older, and this fact put me at ease, as I was not the oldest man in the room(he was older, in bad shape and I figured he would be the first to go, though I did not wish him dead). He never mentioned family and I figured there was no one, or none who cared, and it was sad to be alone and dying, with nothing but faith in God. Right or wrong. I see why he was a devout believer, as it gave him comfort against what waited for him and waited for me, and in this we were brothers, but not for our skins.</p>

  <p>Mr. Blanchard was a dirt farmer in his younger days. When most the farms failed he came North looking for work in the factories, with no luck, until the war and there were no white men left to hire. He swept floors and cleaned toilets and was grateful for the honest work, but it was work on the lines is what he wanted, for the better pay and good treatment from the boss. “We regret it is not possible,” they said; he was too valuable doing what he was doing, “sweeping floors and cleaning toilets.” How could he be replaced, as his people are best suited for that work? He asked, politely, with respect, “is this why I do not see colored on the line?” “You cannot work the line,” the boss answered. “And it is not because you are colored…no matter what you think.” His job was threatened; he understood and thanked the boss for his time. Amos was a big man, as I could tell from the size of his hands; huge hands, long and thick fingers, beaten up and deformed, like they were smashed with a hammer. I never saw him stand at his full height, but he claimed in his youth he stood over six feet tall, and in that he would have been a giant next to me. He never left his bed, not once, not even to exercise that he said he would enjoy. His mattress, his sheets, always damp from spilling off the bedpan, and when he told the nurses, they promised new sheets tomorrow, on “change day.” **Domani. Domani. Sempre domani**.</p>

  <p>He was used to being last in line; always, as he understood it was his place in the world. Patience is a gift, he said, from his God, who he loved. I cannot imagine the shame this man felt, every day, to the last days of his life. Two, three times I send my son to complain about the smell (a complaint they might understand) and the nurses would come and roll Amos over and clean his bed and dry him off, but not change his sheets unless it was “change day. Orazio said I should not be concerned by his troubles (with the bedpans) as these people do not live like we live or believe what we believe. “He has it good,” Orazio said. “Better than most where he comes from.” I began to wonder if what I thought was true. At home, in Sicilia, cento anni fa, I knew there were colored men in the world, from soldiers who did time in Africa, and what they said about the colored was not Catholic, as I could tell. Patri Carmine saw them in Roma, but they were priests and educated men, so he could not swear about the rest, “but they are all children of God.” Did he mean it? The first colored man I see, it was the day we come off the boat, and four of them were standing on the dock, working the brooms; black, shiny skin, like coal, and quiet as they watched each step we took, like caged animals. I understand their thinking; a thousand men, white men, were charging like a horde, and in the back of my mind I knew the Americani hung them from a tree for showing disrespect. The coloreds stared down at the dock as we passed. Enzo believed it to be the custom, that they were not allowed to look us in the eyes. He read it about colored in America or colored in some other place. He could not recall. The sight of black skin was new to me, and I admit this, the strangeness of it bothered me some, as it was odd thing to look on a man who was not white, like me. But there are men who say I am not white.</p>

  <p>The railroad hired colored in the winter, to shovel off rails and heat switches. It was something to see when they come looking for work; six or seven packed in an old car, missing a fender, or all the fenders, or in some rusted out truck, near in pieces. They were hired, ten or twenty at a time, as winter help. A few would quit the first week, saying the work was not to their liking, or they hated the cold and the snow and wanted to go back home. I never thought of those people as having a home, or a family. They always asked for money, and one time I kicked in a dollar, after winning ten in a game of briscola( I took the Irish for a ride after they finished off a bottle of cheap whiskey). Mostly, the coloreds were good workers, as good as me; a few were better. **Joe Cardinal** (Cardinalli in the old country) was section boss after **Tommy Murphy** passed. Joe claimed to be full born American, but we knew he was born in Sicilia, and come here as a boy, and went to the American schools where he learned English with almost no accent, unless you listened close. ‘I love this country,’ he would say, mostly when he was drinking, but he never became a citizen, or did he carry a gun for his beloved country, or lose his life, his limbs, like so many others who did not share his great love. “No time,” he said, when asked why not. “Too busy working making my own way.” When the men talked together, we spoke the language we were born to. If Joe heard us, “This is America, God damn It…speak English,” he would say, spitting out the words like a crazy man. He did not seem to like the Italiani, or being Italiano, himself. “Why is this?” **Joe Pepper** (Peppardi) asked him one day. “The too’s,” he answered. “These ginny’s are too loud and too lazy.” I hear him say to the big boss **Boyle**, but joking I guess, he would trade his Italian crew for a crew of “tizzuns,” any day, as you can kick them and abuse them, and they never complain. One day, all day, Cardinal leans on **Andrea Pizzuto**, who grabbed him and threatened to beat him raw. Joe breaks away and called the railroad bulls who fired Pizzuto and threw his ass off the yards. I put up with Cardinal to keep my job, until one day I hear this from **Enrico Traiano**, that Joe beat his wife when he was drunk. Enrico had neighbors who knew neighbors, and the Irish cops looked the other way, because the Italiani were not worth the trouble, not even the women. I thought about pushing him in front of a fast train coming through the yards. I did not have the guts, and I did not know his wife, or was I related to her. Behind his back we called him ‘Joe Americano,’ this heartless sonofabitch. He always picked on **Henry** (no last name) who was blacker than the other colored, and he limped and never talked, and if he did, he slurred his words and was hard to understand. They say he was hit hard on the head, with a rock, when he was caught stealing apples from an orchard, in the town where he was born. “You black bastards all belong in the jungle,” Joe says to Henry, screaming and spitting in his face, because Henry had busted a lantern when he slipped on the ice. Joe carried a knife he took from a colored man, so he said (no one believed him), and claimed no fear of these people. He refused to let them in the shanty, even when the ground was covered by ice and snow, and the wind strong enough and cold enough to burn the skin clear off a man’s face. Joe’s Place, he called the old shack. When coloreds come to the door, freezing, they would rattle the handle, asking to come in, begging on bad days. “We’re full up,” Joe would say, and laugh; and when he laughed, the white men laughed, then he laughed harder, and told them, “Go back to the jungle if you want warm.” Once in a while a few of the men would walk away to hide their disgust, and Joe would laugh. “Look at them…their skin is leather…they like the cold.” I believe he thought it to be true. The colored never argued, never fought back, and they seemed content to eat, if they had lunch, around a barrel fire, or in an open freight car, that did nothing but break the wind(one or two complained over the years, but the bulls threw them off the property). Joe liked the Mexicans. “They know their place…they’re cleaner,” he said of them. I tell this to the priest one day, when I see him outside the Church, that the colored men were left out to freeze. Patri nodded; he understood, since he heard these stories before, from colored who were from Georgia, but Catholic. “It is a sin to treat men this way, certainly,” he said, scratching his lower lip. “The Church teaches we are all children of God, and demands we treat the colored as we would treat any white man.” When he says this, he pauses and nods and looks around the street. “Ugh, but if the weather is bad, and there no room in the shanty. And someone must stay outside…well…” I did not protest this priest. To this day I am ashamed. Joe Cardinal, this sonofabitch, collected a big pension, and cash, when a boxcar door slipped off the hinges and breaks both of his legs. There were ten men in his crew, but as I recall only three men pitched in to lift the iron door off his body. That was in July. Christmas time, I see him fall on the ice in front of the bank. He called my name, “Sparacino, Sparacino, give me a hand up,” but I did the right thing, pretending I did not see him, or hear him. Enough of this. I suffer for things I have suffered for before.</p>

  <p>Three nights back, maybe four, I caught this bad pain in my head, that sat in the back of my eyes. It was fierce is all I can say, burning, like I imagine hell. I beg the night nurse for pills, and color was of no matter, if they worked. She gives me the red pills this time; more powerful, she said. I waited and prayed. She pulled the shades on her last round, and without moonlight, the room was black, like a cave. I fell off, thank God, and sometime in the night I wake up, expecting to see the bastard with the white eyes, but I hear Amos, crying and talking at the same time. “Enough…no more,” or something like that. I am not certain. Maybe he called my name, or it was the pills and I imagined it all. In the morning his bed was empty, made up clean, a new spread and two pillows, one atop the other. I clear my throat. The big nurse, Signora O’Neil, was puttering and making me nervous. I cleared my throat again, and finding my nerve I ask, “Mister Blanchard? Is he…?” “Sad, poor thing,” she said. “But isn’t it a blessing? Didn’t you hear the commotion?” “I heard nothing,” I said, and it was an honest answer, as I never know if what I hear is really happening or happening in my mind. My head, always buzzing. And my ears. I do not believe she cared much for Mr. Blanchard, even though he was dead, when people always say good things about the deceased. She took no pause to think or choose her words properly; not even to pretend she cared, or anyone cared. Such a thing is hard and cruel. When a man dies there should be silence, at least a kind of respect, and she had none. “They found him on morning rounds, clutching the buzzer. No strength to ring it, I guess. You must have heard something?” She went on with her business, happy to be alive, humming her foolish tune. She stopped at the window and looked done at the street. “The weather is better today. No snow. Isn’t that nice?” ‘Sad,’ she said ‘sad.’ Was it the truth? ‘Sad.’ Did she mean it? I give her…what do these Americans say…I give her the benefit of my doubt. Her job is to save a life, and when a man dies, it was their fault in some way; maybe someone did not do the job for which they were paid to do. Sad. I think they should be sad. “His people believe in heaven, right,” she asked me. What did I know? “Then he’s better off, don’t you think?” She pulled the door back and kicked the stopper in place. The hall was noisy, full of doctors and nurses, but there was no one to help Mr. Blanchard when the time came. This I do not understand. “I am sure the night staff did what they could.” She smiled. “Of course, they did.” “Between you and me he should not have been our patient, anyway. County hospital, Memorial General, is full.” She bent and whispered, “It’s where the colored go because they have no money. Mostly welfare.” She sees her reflection in the window, and stops to straighten the white cap, that was always crooked on her head; she complained she had no pin to keep her hat in place, as she left the house in a rush to catch the bus, because she is not paid enough to afford a car of her own, like the doctors. She looked at the open door. “May I ask a question?” she says. “I am curious…for my own information.” “Anything,” I say. “Ask me anything.” She walked through the open door and looked up and down the hallway. She nodded, said hello to another nurse and come back in. Quietly she says, “Did they ask if you would share a room with a colored man? Not that it makes any difference to me, but I am curious. I have heard complaints.” She asked me this question with her back to me, as she stared at the door, and I believe she was embarrassed by her own question. “I ask because, well, most white people will refuse to share a room with, uh, with a colored person. We are supposed to ask.” She turns and stares at me. “Did they ask? It’s the rule.” I say no, they did not ask, but what complaint do I have? Who wants to share a room with an old, broke down immigrant; they say we smell like garlic and olive oil, and I wonder why this is bad? She shakes her head and points a finger at me, as if I had committed some wrong. “I knew it, I knew it. They have no respect for patients. None at all.” I tell Orazio, buy a mass card if Amos Blanchard was Catholic, and maybe send a nice note to his family. But I wonder, are the coloreds Catholic? I have never seen colored in our church, and I do not believe he had a family, or they cared little for him as none came to visit. Thank God the room never filled with colored to steal from me, and Orazio could not say “I told you so.” If I could walk, I would go to his funeral. We were not brothers, not even friends, but he seemed a decent, with no vices in his youth, and he was a religious man. This is what he said. Michele is standing at the window, watching the new snow. It calms him, he says, the soft snow falling to the ground. No sound. No nothing. Me? I hate the snow, and see no reason for it, except I made overtime money when it snowed. “Very peaceful,” he said, and I thought it was a strange thing for a young man to say. Very peaceful. Old men say, “very peaceful.” Old women, not young boys. “So, this is your **Irish lace**,” I say. He stared at me, in his own world. Irish Lace. Did he know what I said? No matter. I did not explain. I hope he is thinking of Amaria. “**Vienne cca**, come here,” I say. “Drag the chair close.” He points at himself. “Me? Are you talking to me, grandpa? “No. The other guy.” He looked, and seeing no other guy, he smiled. “Of course, I am talking to you. **Ascolti**…listen.” My hand trembled as I point to the chair. “Sit down. I will tell you things you do not know. And this…and this…this…” I stuttered, I made no sense, like an old fool. I could not go on. From nowhere, no warning, the pain in my head, and I see two Michele’s, and one Michele was smiling and holding my hand, and the other was like a scared child. The whole of the goddamned room was spinning around my head, and my eyes, my lungs were on fire. The pain was fierce, tearing at my insides, maybe ripping me to pieces. I recall screaming, pleading for mercy, begging for peace from all of this. I hacked into my open hand, until my throat was raw. Green spit and yellow spit, that spilt onto the fresh bedspread. It was hot in the room, like a boiler room, and I shivered, more from fear than the heat. No red in my hand or on the sheets. No blood. How bad can it be if there is no blood? Michele was clawing at the wall, like some wild man, trying to pull the buzzer away from the hall. “The buzzer, grandpa. The buzzer. We need the nurse…the nurse.” I did not want the goddamned nurses, with their pill carts and the tubes hanging from the neck, picking and prodding at me, like I was cattle. “No….no goddamn nurse…it will pass.” It did pass, but slow and painful, and it gave me time to think, but as the pain lessened, I wondered what or who I had to thank. Did I want it over for now, or forever? I believe I said a small prayer, but I have no clear memory of it. I reached for the water glass and tipped it over and the sheets on my bed were soaked, and I lay sweating and freezing at the same time. Michele brought towels from the toilet, and wiped my forehead dry, and the back of my neck. For a time, near an hour, he held my hand, squeezing it from time to time and when he did, we both smiled. Another time, I would be embarrassed, but not then; I wanted him close and offered no apology. A hundred times he asked, ‘are you alright?’ Was I alright? Should he get a doctor? A nurse? Nobody, I say. I look square at his face. I wished Carmela was here. “How about you? Will you send a bill for your services?” I thought it was funny and I laughed and coughed at the same time and the pain came back, like a knife cutting away at my insides. Michelle looked worried and I regretted he saw me fall apart at the end. Sorry for it, and ashamed I showed weakness in front of him. What example was I to this young man? After a while it was all gone, the god damned pain, and I should have been calm, but no, I was agitated and restless, a bomb wanting to explode. If the pain comes back, this will be the end of me, and I panicked. Who would not panic? As my mind cleared, I remember there were things I have not said that I must say to him, and now, not tomorrow. I worried how he would remember me after I showed such weakness, like a goddamned coward. “Close the door. I want to talk with you.” He did like I said, never asking why. I try to build my nerve, that was slow coming, but he is a patient boy and he sat and waited, with no complaint. All night he would have waited, if I asked. **Rispetto**. He has respect for me. “Listen to me, Michele. I want to keep your.” He squeezed my hand. “Lose respect for you?” He shook his head. “Never. I respect you like I respect papa. No different.” I pat his hand. “I hope you speak from your heart, Michele, not just saying what you think you should say to soothe an old man who happens to be your grandfather.” He smiled and rubbed my arm, and complained it was black and blue and he will tell his father, who will complain to the nurses. “No. No complaints,” I say, maybe too loud for a hospital. “We do not complain. Now I have important things to say, and I want you to listen and understand.” “Important, grandpa? You have never told me important things.” “I have not and that is my fault. You have asked me many times where I come from.” He laughed and dropped his head. “I did, grandpa. And you always said, ‘I come from the moon.’ I believed you when I was a boy. Even then Papa said you were fooling. He said you came from the other side of the world, on a **DC-3**. In the cargo pit. A stowaway, like in the movies.” “Your father is **Jack Benny**. A man who likes to tell jokes.” My son, Orazio, I have not known him to be a funny man. I tried not to laugh, or cough, but I coughed, and it hurt bad. Michele tried to comfort me, but I waved him back. He is the child, and the law is the grandfather comforts the child. “So, he says I come here on a DC-3? The joke, and why we laugh, is that I would not have the guts to get on an airplane. He knows it. Now, I will tell you the truth.” Michele moved his chair closer, until it touched the frame of the bed. “I was packed into the cellar of an iron boat, with a thousand more like me. We never saw the sun for three weeks…si, three weeks.” Michele laughs. “I knew it was no plane. **Mr. Scalfaro**, from down the block, he said you were a farmer, like him. A hard worker. From the same town…that’s all he ever said.” “Scalfaro talks too much.” “But you were a farmer? Right, grandpa? Mr. Scalfaro said it. He wouldn’t lie?” “If I was a farmer, Scalfaro was a farmer, but he thinks too much of himself. We were not farmers. Castello. That sonofabitch, owned the farm and he owned me, and Giacomo, and Giovanni, and Paola, and all the rest. Castello was the farmer. I only worked his land, with a hundred more like me and Scalfaro, and we kept Castello rich (he was born a rich man). To this day, he still owes me three days’ pay…from fifty years ago. Should I sue him? I know a lawyer, but I do not believe he would be interested?” These goddamned pills. I am talking like a fool.</p>

  <p>“Papa says after you left Sicily where you were born, you never went back.” I feel my head drop, and my chin laying against my chest. Was I falling asleep; maybe worse.? I see the village where I was born, and the mountain that hung over her, and the piazza where people met after Church. I run into **Signore Baccelli**, who says that every day my mother walked to the top of the mountain road, waiting for me to come home. She would stay a good hour, and figure that day was not the day, and she went home to make dinner and sew, maybe clean if it was not too late. Baccelli shook his head. “You never come back,” he said, showing disgust for me and men like me. “Even when she passed, you never came back. I hear you promised to come back, but you never did.” “No. I did not go back. I would go home now, but it is too late.” “Too late? How do you mean too late?” I wonder who I am talking to, Michele, or Baccelli, the nosey sonofabitch? I shake my head and stare through the window. It was Michele, I see. “It is too late,” I say to him. “You never saw them again. Your family. You left them all behind?” “What do you want me to say?” “You say family is everything. I don’t understand.” Michele has called me out, like a man would do, and for this I am more than proud to be his grandfather. But if I tell the truth, what will he think, and what will he say about me when I am gone? He will judge me, and he knows nothing about me. Starvation? What does he know about the terrible ache, or the dead babies, when the icebox in father’s kitchen is full, and the food rots there is so much? Or your mouth swells because you cannot drink because the water is dirty, a toilet water for a thousand animals. When he is sick, or says he is sick, his mother calls to the doctor, and she tells him hurry, poor Michele is under the weather. What hope was there for us? Being alive and being dead, almost the same thing. We were ruled by these bastards and beaten by these bastards, the bad priests, the bosses and the troublemakers. ‘**Agitatori**,’ the bad priest called them, telling us to ignore what they said, as they were no more than criminals from the big city, and worse, they were godless. When they come to the fields, these **facinorosi**, we were forbidden to listen when they spoke. They said ‘**sciopero**,’ strike, refuse to work for the shit we were paid, and the beatings we took from the overseers. The **Carribieneri** came, as if they knew, and chased these men away, sometimes catching one, or two if they were lucky, near the woods where they hid. They were beaten good when they were captured, and I still hear breaking bones, like a tree limb splitting in a storm. A priest always came with the cops; not our priest, but a bad priest from **Messina**. He would stand on the high ground and preach, black robe snapping in wind off the mountain. The owner by his side, but always two steps behind to show respect, always making the sign of the cross at just the right time, when the priest did. These men of God always said the same thing. “There is a place in heaven, with God Almighty, for men who suffer, but do not lose faith, or despair. You will be saved by following the law of Holy Mother Church.” Did I despair? Goddamn right I did. From the day I was born. I could never live like they wanted me to live, God’s will or not. I left, but with an aim to return. I swear it. Hand to God. The real God. Not the priest’s god, or the owner’s god, or the politicians god.</p>

  <p>When I finally tell my family, ‘I am leaving on the boat,’ mama cried and grabbed my arm, swearing an oath to God, she would not allow it. She cursed America. Papa said nothing but grabbed wine and walked to the overlook and stared at the sea. **Paolo**, my brother, said he was glad I made this decision, vowing to join me when I called. My sisters, **Maria** and **Agatha**, held mama and they cried together, like women do. **Salvatore** was our baby, maybe ten, eleven years old. Maybe twelve. He was the smartest; good with words and saying what he was thinking. He said to my face I was abandoning the family, for some fool’s dream, like mama said. My right hand to God, I promised I would return and not leave them on their own. I meant no lie, or hasty promise, but what was in my heart at the time. A few years of hard work in America, and I would return with money, and buy a small piece of land for the family. Now I know; me and a million others said the same thing and many failed. I wake from the sleep, or the trance, or the daydream, whatever it was. Michele is rubbing his hands on his knees and rocking in the chair. “Grandpa? You were talking about Paolo and Salvatore. Who are these people?” He asks, “who are these people?” My fault. I have not mentioned my other family in all these years, like they never existed. Not even my children know, but Carmela knows; she knew them in the old country. She was close to my sisters, as women will be, and I believe she wrote to them, or they wrote to her a few times, but not in years. “Who are these people, you ask? My brothers, Paolo and Salvatore.” Michele’s eyes were wider than I have seen them before. “Papa? Does he know you have brothers? That he has uncles in Sicily?” “I am not sure...no, I do not believe I ever told him.” I tapped. I was nervous and I needed to tap, but I only tap on a table and this nurse has moved the table away from the bed. Tapping I started in the guts of the boat, to pass the time; it soothes me to this day, but I hate it when other men do it, because I believe it is a sign of weakness and something only fools do and a waste of time. Michael cleared his throat, and leaned in his chair, elbows on his knees. He was nervous, I could see; squirming in the chair, while he stared me straight in the eyes. “You have two brothers, and two sisters in Sicily? Is there more family?” He is like a little boy again, excited at the zoo. Did he want a hotdog and a root beer, in the brown bottle? Hires Root Beer is the best. “More family? Maybe, but I do not know for sure. My mother, my father, are long since dead. You would be their favorite. I am sure of it.” “Why is that grandpa?” I shake my head, but like the men would do in the old country, I never answered him. “And my sisters, Maria and Agatha, both young and beautiful the last I saw them, and if they are alive, I know they are still beautiful women. Sicilian women never age, get old, and if they get the deep lines, the lines add a beauty to their face. Carmela has not aged. I remember my sisters stood in the street, holding mama’s hand and crying. There was **Giovanna**, the little flower, who died some years before I left home. I am ashamed to say I have not thought much about her in years. But the day I left I stopped at her grave and prayed for her soul and I do not believe I have prayed since that day and admit I was angry God took her away. It was after Church. I took her hand and we walked to the fountain for a drink of water. On **lunedi** she told mama she was sick, and her stomach ached, and her head was sore, and it was the same for five or six of the children who were at Mass that day. By **giovedi** she was dead with **Angelo Martini’s** daughter (God forgive me I cannot remember her name). We buried Giovanna on **domenica**, after mass, in a white dress given by **signora Mucci**, who lost both her daughters and had no need for it. God bless her, and her daughters. Patri spoke over the grave while we wept, even the men, and he said, and I am sure he believed what he said, that the reason God took her is a mystery, but there was a purpose to it and part of His plan. Killing a child is part of a plan? Patri was right, this I could not understand, but I went to many funerals of children and never thought about it until my own sister was dead.</p>

  <p>“Why did she die, grandpa?” He waited for me to answer. “Papa can ask **Father Mascagino** to say a mass for her soul…what do you think?” I thought about her and what Michelle said about my little flower. “What do I think? I think it has been a long time, and her soul was pure and needs no prayer to save her. She has already been saved. I am sure of it.” I cleared my throat. “And that you do not ask me a thousand times, I cannot tell you why she died. Bad water, maybe. I do not know. Many children died that year died as soon as they were born, or short after. She was lucky. She lived a few years. Mama did not leave her bed for a long time, or did she talk or eat until she was near collapse. Papa brought food and it lay on the floor and gave it to the animals when it went bad. She fought sleep, fearing Giovanna would call out to her and she would not hear and could not go to her. She said a thousand time she no longer wanted to live. I remember this, like it was yesterday.”</p>

  <p>Then he asked about my sisters, Maria and Agatha? They married, I am certain, and they went where their husbands went. Where are they now? I do not know. Sicilia is not America. Then to change the subject, I mention **Giovanni Iannuzzo**, who come to America with his cousin, to **New York**, and his family in Sicilia moved to Calabria because their home was destroyed by an earthquake. Who knew where anybody was? Ten years later, after no word from his family, he is at **Coney Island** with his wife, but I do not know her name. They are on the Ferris wheel and sitting in the seat below he sees his sister, **Carmela**. She married in Calabria and come to America five or six years before. It was a joyous reunion I am told. Anyway, my sisters, Agatha, Maria, I hope they are alive and enjoying a good life, with children and grandchildren, to comfort them. My brother Paolo? The priest wrote a letter to the **Sindaco** (mayor), but no answer. In a year he sent another. Same thing. No answer. Maybe some war. Who can say? Salvatore and Giovanna, I know are dead, for many years.” I make the sign of the cross. “Salvatore was murdered in the war, with a bullet, or a mortar shell, then gassed. I hear different stories. But he was killed, murdered by someone. What difference who, or the way or the time?”</p>

  <p>Michele leaned off his chair. “So, papa has an uncle who was killed in the war? **World War 1**? Do you remember what battle?” He shakes his young head, slowly. “Dead in the war. I can’t believe it.” I raise my hand, that shook, and I was too weak to keep it up, so it meant nothing. “**Aspetta**. It is shameful to be excited by war.” He dropped his head, and I was sorry for what I said. He is a child. What does he know? I reached for his hand. “Maybe there is an old letter, I cannot recall. I will ask your grandmother to look.” I was glad he was interested in family, but most he was interested in Salvatore, because he died in war. I was disappointed in that, but I understood, that for a boy who has never known tragedy, or felt the great pain of losing someone, it was exciting to be kin to a man who died in battle, no matter that he suffered. What does this boy know about anything? “Killed in the war,” he said it again, and I was almost sorry for telling him. I should have left well enough alone. Now I think he would be disappointed by Salvatore, who was no fighter. This I knew. If only men like Salvatore were taken into armies, this would be a quiet and peaceful world, and there would be no war stories to tell a grandson.</p>

  <p>Mama and papa. Salvatore. Giovanna. All dead, for certain; this is all I could say. The big nurse, O’Neil, stood at the threshold of the door, her thick arms, man’s arms, folded and she frowned, like the bull she was. “Visiting hours are over,” she says, looking direct at Michelle. “You must leave.” She poked her finger in the air, like some **cavone**. Where is her respect? This is enough. I will fight her myself, but when I lifted my head from the pillow, the pain, like fire, ran through my neck, and I become meek, ashamed to not be a man, showing this weakness in front of my grandson. “We are talking family,” I said to her. “You know my problem.” I think, maybe she would feel some pity for me and to hell with the rules. These rules? What have they done for me? What are they doing for her? But no. She looked square at me, and for the first time I notice her face; how old she looked, how deep her eyes were set back in her head. She was an old woman, and time is worse for woman than men. And she was younger than me, but not much. I felt sorry for her, that she would soon be in my place. “Mister Sporceeny. Please. Your grandson. He must leave…and now!” Michele come off the chair like his ass was burning; shoulders hunched, like a cat wanting to pounce. She stared back, not flinching or turning away, as I expect most women would do. She twists her face in a strange way. I look at Michele, staring her down. My God. He was giving her the **malocchiu**, the evil eye. She wrinkled her forehead, and smiled, but showed little worry. What a fool she was not to fear the malocchiu. No matter what these Americans say, the curse is real. I knew a family wiped out by the curse; I see what it does to people who laugh and scoff at its power. **Patri** said the malocchiu is from Satan, not God, and not the teaching of the Church, though he believed it worked sometimes. “Why are you looking at me like that?” she says to Michele, who did not back off an inch. “It’s rude. You are a rude young man…I said visiting hours are over!” This foolish woman is now cursed. Does she know it? Doomed, but all she worries about is visiting hours. She walks toward the open door. “You better leave,” I whisper to Michele. “Or this cavone will call the law…she wants to call the law…she would feel good for calling the law.” He leaned and kissed my cheek, said goodbye, saying quietly, he would come on Sunday after church. “You can finish your story when I see you again.” I know him like the back of my hand; he will be like a cop and question the whole family, about what they know and who told them, and he will show up with a million questions. He passed the threshold, into the hall; he turned and said another goodbye. “Si, Sunday. I will finish the story,” I said, but I do not believe he heard me. If I am here on Sunday. I will be here. Sunday is only a few days away.</p>

  <p>These sonofabitchs said I would like the pills. They were right, but I will not admit it. Floating in air, like a feather, is a good feeling. All I want to do is sleep. All I want to do is sleep. All I want to do is sleep. Rest old man; see the Irish lace dance in the breeze. Sleep. The road is bad, worse than I remember it; steep and treacherous, and the ruts are deep. **Mio Diu**, you can still lose a mule over the side. I hear the bells on the **Chiesa di Sant’ Agatha**. The air is cool and sound travels miles in the cool air. Were they ringing when I left? My legs will give out before I reach the top, but I know mama and papa will meet me, and we will walk home together. They will be glad to see me, and tell their friends, “He has come home, like he promised. He is a good son.” They will all be proud of me.</p>
