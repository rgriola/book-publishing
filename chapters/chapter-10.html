        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Smell of the Sea and the Call for Help</h3>

        <p>I see off in the night, flickering lights, like beacons at sea. We were getting close to the city. I thanked God and <em>Santo</em> got on his knees and thanked God and made the sign of the cross. It was near nine o’clock at night, by <em>Santo’s</em> old and tarnished watch, a gift from his grandfather, but it kept good time. At the edge of the city, we see an old man on the ground, but not asleep, more leaning against a splintered hitching post, his covering his eyes, as if to shut out the world.</p>
        <p>“<em>Buonasera</em>,” I said, but he only grunted and otherwise ignored me.</p>
        <p>“The ferry, <em>signuri</em>? Can you give directions to the ferry?” I asked him politely, but instead he snorted and coughed and looked away. <em>Santo</em> checked the old man up and down. “Is he deaf?”</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> pushed <em>Santo</em> aside. “The ferry,” he yelled, like a mad overseer, and the old man was startled and leaned right, and pointing down the deserted street.</p>
        <p>“<em>Un miglio</em>,” he said. ‘A mile, or so…a short ways…and I meant no disrespect, but I am weak and hungry…do you have food…maybe <em>grappa</em>?”</p>
        <p>“No. Nothing to spare,” <em>Luca</em> said, annoyed and pushing at my back to move me along.</p>
        <p><em>Santo</em> stared down at the man, who had slid from the post and lay flat on the ground. “I will pray for you,” he said, making the sign of the cross. The old man shook his head. “Prayers? You see me half dead and you offer prayers? I would rather have a plate of beans, maybe a turnip, if you can spare one. I have not eaten in two days.”</p>
        <p>We walked on and did not look back, but to this day I hear his plea for help.</p>
        <p>In two or three blocks the street began to fill in with people. The buildings were old, but the cobblestone was pretty new, and we see black, iron hitching posts planted on each side of the street. Not a horse to be seen. How was it a great city survive without no horses or mules? We have been here before, at least me and <em>Luca</em> (<em>Santo</em> has never been anywhere). But I knew little of the city, as I was here just a few months, and never walked the streets searching for cheap whores, like the rest of the men, who said this part of <em>Messina</em> was best for finding <em>puttanu</em>. Thank God, I never shared the vile weakness of these men, as they were likely to suffer sores and other maladies, and some would die in agony(<em>Patri Carmine</em> said this). God rest their souls, these men, but I have never prayed for them.</p>
        <p><em>Santo</em> nudged my arm, his eyes bugging. “My God. These people. Where do they all come from?”</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> laughed. “People? This is nothing. There will be ten times the number in the morning. They live underground.” He smiled. “Some crawl out from the cracks and dance all night, and in the morning, when the sun comes up, the rest join them.” <em>Santo</em> stared at the cracks as we walked, complaining on a pain in his neck that kept his head low for relief. At the next streetlamp we come on this carriage, fancy painted, and drawn by a good a good- and healthy- looking mare. She was nervous and wanted to go and pranced in place. A well-attired man stood next to the carriage and looked to be a class never of man never seen in <em>Sicilia</em>. When we came within a few feet, he put his hands in the air and waved us down.</p>
        <p>“<em>Scusa</em>,” he said, <em>molto</em> politely. “I am looking for <em>Via Umberto</em>. Do you know where it is?” A good month ago, he said, the wife of his oldest son gave birth to a child. “A boy, thank God.” But they just received the letter, and were anxious to see the child, especially his wife, who is happy to finally be grandmother to a child, and it was a boy. A girl would have been acceptable, but a boy was better. “We are from <em>Caserta</em>, near <em>Napoli</em> and have not seen our son for a year. My wife says it is her duty to help with the child, but we cannot find his street and it is getting late.” He looked up and down the street. “And this part of town…my wife is nervous. No offense to you men, of course.”</p>
        <p>“No apology needed, <em>signuri</em>,” I said. “But we are strangers here, and probably lost.” He nodded that he understood, but was grateful we stopped, and thanked us for our time. He handed me a coin, that I refused.</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> gives me a dirty look. “<em>Grosso colpo</em>,” he said. “Big shot.”</p>

        <!-- Section 2: Searching for a Drink -->
        <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">Grappa, Whores, and Low Life</h3>

        <p>After a few long blocks, the street narrowed in, barely wide enough for a double cart and a pair of well-built draught horses. And deserted, again. <em>Luca’s</em> mole people went back through the cracks, leaving us near alone on the street, but for a few soldiers and sailors, mostly leaning against the buildings, or staggering on the street. <em>Luca</em> pushed his elbow into my ribs.</p>
        <p>“Remember the days, <em>Antonino</em>?” He laughed. “Good <em>grappa</em>…cheap whores.” “<em>Grappa</em> and whores? No, <em>Luca</em>, I do not recall those days.”</p>
        <p>We see four men at a table in front of a shabby bar, and by their looks I figured them to be seadogs off one of the iron freighters, or some other derelict boat in the harbor. They were noisy and rowdy, but they were not Navy, though I have seen sailors who were noisy and rowdy and drunk at shabby bars. These four? I believe they had been bested by <em>grappa</em>, as each man had a near empty bottle within his reach. They were playing cards, <em>Briscola</em>, I think, and they ignored us, thank God, as these men go violent if bothered. <em>Luca</em> said he was dead tired but needed a kick in the ass that only <em>grappa</em> could do. Me? My legs were stiff and tired from the long walk; I wanted only to rest, <em>grappa</em> being of no interest to me.</p>
        <p>It is a poor plan we made. <em>Grappa</em>, but no place to spend the night. <em>Santo</em> wet his lips. “We should have a last drink in <em>Sicilia</em>. Who knows for how long?”</p>
        <p>“Maybe there is <em>grappa</em> in America.” <em>Santo</em> said. <em>Luca</em> stared him down.</p>
        <p>“Maybe they have <em>grappa</em> in America? If they is no <em>grappa</em> in America, what is the sense of going?”</p>
        <p>“We stop for one drink,” I said. “Who has money to piss away on two?”</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> slapped my shoulder. “Big shot. You should have taken the coin, my friend.”</p>
        <p><em>Santo</em> repeated he did not care to stop, and sitting in a bar, as every civilized man knows, is a waste of good life, and the men at the table looked to be of the low life and disorderly kind. His real fear, I knew, was <em>Luca</em>, because <em>grappa</em> changes him, even one drink, or the thought of the drink. He is not falling down, or does he piss himself (not often) but when he drinks, there is no reasoning with him. Two, maybe three drinks at most and he is no longer <em>Luca</em>, but some man I do not trust. <em>Santo</em> drinks <em>grappa</em>, but he says no, never, not once, but I have shared <em>grappa</em> with him. He claims to dislike the harshness of the sting, but the truth is he does not like to pay, so preaching on the evil of drink suits his purpose (except his uncles’ wine, that he drinks free).</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> raises his right hand.</p>
        <p>“One drink and no more,” he promised, but <em>Santo</em> knew the truth, and complained on the look of the bar and the shabby men at the table, so we walk on looking for a place suitable to his gentle nature. But as we walked, the meaner, more violent the men became and the buildings, more rundown, and the street older, and the cobblestones loose and heaving, not tight to the ground. We were closer to the waterfront than before, as I see civilization was falling part. Who cares about the waterfront, with its derelicts and fallen women, and <em>contadini</em> who abandon <em>Sicilia</em> for a better place, like we are doing?</p>
        <p>We loitered where two streets crossed, watching the men go by, and the carriages and wagons bounce across the rough cobblestone, and the oil lamps flicker and smoke. <em>Luca</em> recalled a bar further on, run by some character he had met, but could not recall his name. The bar was clean, and the drinks were cheap. He swore it to be true.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Fellino's Bar and His Sorrow -->
        <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Bar of the Oldest Brother</h3>

        <p>We come to this bar that <em>Luca</em> remembered from the ‘old days,’ a battered stone building, lifeless, but he acted like it was home. “It has not changed a bit,” he said, rubbing his hand across a sign with faded red letters and a thick wooden door, that has not seen paint in years. A harmless looking old man sat alone at a round table, asleep; his head thrown back and propped by the high back chair. “That’s him,” <em>Luca</em> said. “I remember, now. <em>Fellino</em> is his name.” On second look the old man could have been dead, as I could not see him breathe when I stared on his chest. I thought to leave right off, as I saw only round tables and I never feel right about leaning on a round table. They were freshly painted, each surrounded by four new chairs, it seemed. The paint job was inferior, though, with runs and drips and bubbles in the finish, and the floor was covered with splatters of paint. The air smelt of linseed oil, wine and <em>grappa</em>, mixed together, but it was a pleasant smell.</p>
        <p>The bar was nothing, a bad sin, so I saw no reason for <em>Luca</em> to remember it, but he swore on being drunk there, at least once, probably many more times than one. I saw a disgraceful place, far worse than the bar in the <em>piazza</em> back home, but <em>Luca</em> demanded we stay for one drink, maybe two, as it was promised to him. He picked the table and sat first, his back to the wall and facing the door. He felt safe, as he could see anyone coming for him, a part of his fantasy. I took a chair and right off I see the dead bodies; six fleas, or some other bug, or parts of bugs, flattened and buried in the paint and staring at me from their grey grave. <em>Luca</em> went to wake the owner, but he tripped on the proud edge of a floorboard and fell against the old man’s chair, who was startled, and he stood up and smoothed his rumpled shirt, apologizing, and swore he was only resting his eyes, trying to throw off a terrible headache; a malady he suffered his whole life.</p>
        <p>“I own this fine place,” he boasted, then complaining he is forced to be the waiter, as his regular man left him for America, or Argentina; he was not sure, and in truth he did not care, and his worker left a poor man and would return a poor man, but he wanted to kill the waiter because he stole money and food for his family.</p>
        <p>“Good riddance to the sonofabitch,” he said, his hands trembling. “I cannot believe I treated this <em>cavone</em> like a son, when customers told me I was a fool. They knew him, I did not. Steal from me…food, money…the sonofabitch.” He kicked the closest chair, knocking it half way across the room, cursing the bastard waiter to hell. “I am glad he is gone…trouble, nothing but trouble.” He raged about this ingrate and what he did for him; that he put shoes on his feet and clothes on his back. Then he spots an entombed flea on the tabletop, and runs his hand across it, denying it was a bug, but a run and he would take care of it when he could, as the paint was still soft, and it could be peeled back with a knife and smoothed with rough paper.</p>
        <p>“Maybe another table?” he asked. “If you came for a meal, you will be disappointed.”</p>
        <p>An impatient man, as I could see, always tapping his fingers on something, so I figure he was well-to-do, as they are generally short with men of our kind. He warned again, he had only drink to sell, wine and <em>grappa</em>, some whiskey, but nothing to eat. No food at all. “I know an inn with no food is a foolish thing, but it is all gone…the food.” He shrugged his shoulders in a way that said he did not give a shit what we thought. “I kept a few loaves for myself, but they are not for sale.” <em>Luca</em> laughed.</p>
        <p>“Not for sale?” he said, aping the bar keeps words. “Then you are the one saloon owner who would not sell his mother’s teeth for a little cash.” <em>Fellino</em> was not insulted.</p>
        <p>“You are correct. The bread I kept is not for sale, at any price. But if by some chance I do sell it to you, remember this, it is stale and will not be to your liking.” He shook his finger, “And there will be no discount. You pay full price. Take it or leave it.” He named the drinks he offered for sale; Sicilian wine, some <em>grappa</em> and a bottle of French liquor, he would not recommend, as the French were like rats, and their liquor tasted like old piss. This is what he said, and he said it proudly and I do believe he hated the French. <em>Fellino</em> was in his sixties, maybe seventies, as it was hard to tell since he was not a well-kept man, but his clothes were of suitable wear for a bar owner, and his hair was cut, and he seemed clean and did not smell, but there was this look in his eyes, that maybe he was tired of living.</p>

        <!-- Section 4: The Tragedies of the Fellino Brothers -->
        <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Price of Leaving and the Spit in the Glass</h3>

        <p><em>Luca</em> leaned in close to me, too close; I did not enjoy being so close to another man. “<em>Fellino</em> knew how to show men a good time. Good food and good drink and plenty of women always just a few <em>lire</em> away. I believe he had two or three in his own stable. Good stamina, for an old man, they said about him.”</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em>, I could see, was an emotional man, drunk or sober, and it was not the wine that brought it on, but memories, they say. Mostly he cried about the old days and how they all left him, promising to return, but did not. He was tough in his day, and well-connected in <em>Messina</em>, and above all a man who knew how to give favors and receive favors in return; well known to the cops and the politicians, who drank and ate and played “<em>gratuito</em>.” <em>Luca</em> put his hand on the old man’s shoulder.</p>
        <p>“You remember me, <em>Fellino</em>, I have been here before.” <em>Fellino</em> nodded but did not answer. <em>Luca</em> put out his hand to renew an old acquaintance, but <em>Fellino</em> only shook his head. “I do not remember you. Where you a soldier? You all looked alike to me.”</p>
        <p>“<em>Si</em>. Three years ago. The army. I spent many nights here.”</p>
        <p>“I am sorry, you are not familiar.” He moved close and stared into <em>Luca’s</em> face, and squinted, finally shaking his head. “I do not know you, <em>signuri</em>. I am sorry.”</p>
        <p>“I drank here every night…<em>Luca Ponto</em>…the army…the whores?”</p>
        <p>“<em>Mi dispiace</em>. As I said, you all look the same to me.” It was embarrassing for <em>Luca</em> that he was not remembered that he was nothing special and did not stand out in <em>Fellino’s</em> mind, and he bitched to <em>Fellino</em> that he spent most of his pay across the bar, and to be forgotten after a few years was an insult.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> shrugged. “<em>Mi dispiace</em>,” he said again. <em>Luca</em> pointed to the back room. “<em>Antonella</em>. Call her out here.” The old man stares at <em>Luca</em>.</p>
        <p>“You know <em>Antonella</em>?”</p>
        <p>“I do. A beautiful girl. Is she here? Send her out.”</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> turns and spits on the floor. “<em>Se n'è andata</em>,” he said, sorrowfully, “She is gone. She does not work here anymore. I fired the <em>puttanu</em> when she took up with that <em>cavone</em>, <em>Umberto Rastelli</em>…a no good…like his father, May they all rot in hell.” <em>Santo</em> made the sign of the cross.</p>
        <p>“Hell is bad,” <em>Luca</em> said. “No disrespect to you, or did I mean to call up bad memories, but she was a fine…” <em>Fellino</em> raised his voice.</p>
        <p>“Do you men want bread, or not?” he said, looking straight at <em>Luca</em>. “If you stay, I give no discounts…full price.”</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> waved <em>Fellino</em> away. “Forget the god damned bread. Bring us three <em>grappa’s</em>, not the pigswill, that piss water you sell the sailors and bring good glasses. Clean, not those iron cups all rusted on the bottom. I still taste the iron in my mouth.” This charge of bad service upset the old man that he could barely speak. He looked square at me, for some reason, not <em>Luca</em>, his real tormentor, and slapped, hard, on the tabletop. “Your friend. He has a big mouth. He should sit with his back to the wall.”</p>
        <p>I apologized for <em>Luca</em>, but the old man was angry and turned his back to me.</p>
        <p>“This pigswill, as he calls it, I do not serve it to paying customers, only the cops and other free loaders, but after I spit in the glass.” He leaned and stared at <em>Luca</em>. “The paying customers get my best and I only serve the best. It has always been my rule.” He stiffens his chest, like a proud man and snapped his wide, black suspenders, that the undertakers wear.</p>
        <p>“Did you hear me? What I said? I spit in the glass for the freeloaders. Something a little extra on the house. As you see, free is not free in <em>Fellino’s</em> place.” I laughed, it was funny, and <em>Luca</em> laughed, but not <em>Santo</em>, who said he did not see the humor.</p>
        <p>“Men can get sick,” he said. <em>Luca</em> pulled <em>Santo</em> from his chair and hugged him around the neck, until he managed to pull away.</p>
        <p>“Were you born yesterday?” he says to <em>Santo</em>. “He spits in the glass to make these bastards sick…his revenge…this is how he fights. The <em>grappa</em> is free, but it is not free. <em>Capisce</em>?” “I know why he does it. But this is dangerous and against the law of God.”</p>
        <p>“It is about suffering, <em>Luca</em>. This man makes the suffering worse, not better…like the woman and the boy a few miles back, and this famine. He spits in the glass of people he does not like…he makes it all the worse. <em>Patri Carmine</em> would say it, too.”</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> was angry. Not furious or violent, but he wanted to know what this talk was all about. “Famine? These people you speak of…this priest, and a woman…a boy? Who are they?”</p>
        <p><em>Santo</em> was confused. “<em>Patri Carmine</em> is our priest back home, and a great man, who has worked with us in the fields and sweated like we sweated. These people we speak of, a woman and a boy, they live near here and are starving. I admit I was not concerned, but it bothers me now. We hear there is famine here. Is it true?”</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> gave a heavy sigh. “Well,” he looked at us and scratched his right arm and complained about the heat. “You ask an interesting question, I admit.” He scratched his face as he thought. “Well, uh, yes,” and he paused for the right words. “We do have a famine, but a small one, only a small one, and of no consequence as famines go, except there has been a long drought. And, yes, regrettably, a few have suffered, mostly the foolish ones. And a few have died. People die every day from many things.” He smiled. “But I have not, so how bad is it?” and realizing he never introduced himself, he stood straight and stiff(but not tall, as he was a short man). “I am <em>Carmine Fellino</em>, proud son of <em>Giuseppe Fellino</em> and <em>Anna Porti</em>, my sainted mother.” He was not of this city, he said, but born near <em>Spadafora</em>, north of <em>Messina</em> and close to the sea, where in his youth he fell asleep each night listening to its pleasant sound. His father, long since dead, opened this bar years ago, before <em>Garibaldi</em> conquered <em>Sicilia</em> (ruining it forever, he said). <em>Lo stupor di Sicilia</em>, the ‘rape of <em>Sicilia</em>,’ his father called it, cursing <em>Garibaldi</em>, and finally dying a broken man because of him. <em>Fellino</em> was tired and almost finished, worn by the day, he said. Could he sit and share our table? He brought <em>grappa</em> and three glasses, setting one at each place, and the bottle in the middle of the table.</p>
        <p>“What is the smell,” <em>Santo</em> asked <em>Fellino</em>?</p>
        <p>“Paint and <em>grappa</em>,” he replied, apologizing for this calamity, promising, his right hand to God, the smell would not make us sick, as it has lingered three days and he was healthy as a horse. To blame for this was a deadbeat customer he allowed (against his better judgment)to work off a <em>grappa</em> debt, by painting the tables and chairs. The quality of the work was poor, but to be expected, and his only hope was to recover his money, but the deadbeat was a drunk and a roustabout, not to be trusted, like the rest of his family, who refused to make the debt good.</p>
        <p>“A mistake I will never make again.”</p>
        <p>He asked, again, could he join us; his legs were on fire from standing all day, and he cursed the “goddamnable heat,” as he wiped his forehead with a wet bar rag.</p>
        <p>“<em>Si</em>, of course.” <em>Luca</em> pulled a chair from the table.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> smiled and bowed from the waist, like a gentleman would do.</p>
        <p>“<em>Grazie</em>.” He took a tall glass from his pocket and set to the edge of the table. His hand shook as he poured, and the <em>grappa</em> spilt, some on the table and some on the floor, but he did not seem to care, saying his only desire was to see us raise our glass to a better <em>Sicilia</em>, blessed by God.</p>
        <p>“<em>Salutè</em>…<em>salutè a tutti</em>.”</p>

        <!-- Section 5: The American Tragedy and the Farewell -->
        <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Traitors and the Coward</h3>

        <p>We raised our glasses proudly and there was the sweet sound of that fine ring when good the glasses are touched. “<em>Salutè</em>,” <em>Luca</em> repeated as he put the glass to his lips, smiled and threw straight back, swallowing in a single noisy gulp; he held his breath, while his hands and shoulders shook.</p>
        <p>“Good <em>grappa</em>,” he said. “Smooth, like sweet water, but in the end like the kick of a mule, not to be forgotten or ignored…the best I have ever had. And now a toast to America,” and <em>Fellino’s</em> ears perk, like a cat who spots a mouse.</p>
        <p>“I thought as much. You goddamned men are going to America. ”</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> nodded. “<em>Si</em>, America. Tomorrow, we take the ferry to <em>Calabria</em>…if it is running.” <em>Fellino</em> chest heaved as he sighs a heavy sigh, and I see how black his eyes were, how deep they set into his head. He was no happy man, for all he had.</p>
        <p>“Every sonofabitch is going to America these days...even my goddamned waiter.” He starred over <em>Luca’s</em> shoulder at the dull, gray wall behind him. “Sooner than later, this godforsaken island will be empty. Who will be left, but old men, like me, and horses and mules, and no one young enough or foolish enough to waste their lives planting and mucking stalls?” Did I ever muck a stall, he asked me? I did, I said.</p>
        <p>“Did it make a man out of you?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“It did nothing for me, as I can tell, except maybe it ruined my back.” He agreed. “I mucked plenty, and it did nothing for me.”</p>
        <p>He relaxed and wiped spilt <em>grappa</em> from the table with the palm of his hand. “You men are chasing a shooting star, and who has ever caught a shooting star?” He slapped the tabletop hard, and it made a hollow sound and he stared at his hand, like a baby would do, then wiped it across his pant leg.</p>
        <p>“My brothers, both of them, went off to America. Years ago. They hated farming and farmers, like death, and the sulphur mines. My God, how they hated the sulfur mines. Like our sainted mother they wanted a better life. Better life? What the hell is a ‘better life,’ I asked them. If you suffer less than the man next to you, then you have the better life. Does this take a great thinker to understand? They were young, then. The day they left, great promises flowed from their mouths. We will write, and you will join us,’ they said and like a fool, I believed they were sincere.” He wiped his eyes with the bar rag slung over his shoulder, apologizing for his show of weakness, that is never manly. “How many years have they been gone? I cannot recall. Ten, maybe twenty. Probably thirty.” He rested his folded hands on the table, like men, but mostly women, do when they pray, and he sighed again. I was embarrassed watching him fall apart.</p>
        <p>Men should not sigh out of frustration, or carry on, or weep for any reason. Even great pain. He turned to the wall and cleared his throat.</p>
        <p>“I have two brothers. <em>Carmelo Fellino</em> and <em>Giovanni Fellino</em>. <em>Carmelo</em> is my youngest brother, the most reckless, and I know I will never see him again, on this side of the river, as he was shot down in the street. Butchered, like an animal. Now he is dead and not reckless anymore.” What is the right to say to a stranger, whose brother was murdered years past, who I never knew? I do not morn dead men to much, except family and only if they have treated me right, and I have never mourned a stranger. <em>Santo</em> pushed his <em>grappa</em> glass to the center of the table and settled back in his chair.</p>
        <p>“Did he fight with cops? Was it the <em>Carabinieri</em>?”</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> cursed and shook his finger in <em>Santo’s</em> face. “Not a cop,” he said. “Does this surprise you? If you knew my brother, you would know he had respect for the law. Your question insults his memory.”</p>
        <p><em>Santo</em> stuttered. “I meant no dis…”</p>
        <p>“It was <em>briganti</em>, <em>signuri</em>, for your information…American <em>briganti</em>, who are the worst of all the <em>briganti</em>, so say men who have been everywhere.” He leaned back and snapped at his suspenders, that I believe he did when he was excited, or agitated. “They beat him and robbed him for the change he carried in his pocket. He fought hard, I know, like a man should fight, but in the end, they had guns and shot him in the face,” and he used his finger like the barrel of a gun, pointing it straight at <em>Santo</em>, who was nervous and turned away. “Guns. Over there, they say, every <em>cavone</em> and his brother carries a gun. Let me know if this is true.” He tapped the tabletop, nervously, as his eyes searched the near empty room.</p>
        <p>“You say this happened in America?” I asked, to be sure it was not Argentina, or Brazil, or some Spanish country. Was it America? He was slow to answer, fumbling with the rolled-up sleeves on his white shirt, held in place with a band, that he slipped off and threw behind the bar.</p>
        <p>“<em>Si</em>. In America. In <em>Bruukland</em>. A pigsty of a place, I have heard. Near the docks, where the <em>marmaglia</em> (rabble) hangout and fester, like here.” He left the table and was gone for some time, or a few minutes, I no longer recall, but his face was red when he returned. I believe he went and hid and cried for his dead brother, and I was glad I did not see him weep, as it is not proper for man, although I have wept, but alone, so I would not lose face in my town. <em>Luca</em> turned to me.</p>
        <p>“Should we leave?” Before I could answer <em>Fellino</em> settled himself and wiped his brow with the bar rag.</p>
        <p>“No need, my friends. Please stay. I feel better when I talk. But I will apologize no more, for anything, or will I explain myself, or justify what I have done.”</p>
        <p>It has been years since that night with <em>Fellino</em>, and I am certain he is long since dead, but I think about him now and then, and for that he is still alive to me. I did not like him, or did I dislike him, but he left me with this feeling it is always better to be healthy in the head, rather than in the body, or the wallet. What good is property and wealth, if you are <em>Fellino</em>.</p>
        <p>The side door opened, and two men entered and stood inside the threshold, looking the place over, floor to ceiling. They were too well dressed to be wandering this part of town, let alone to drink in a place such as this. <em>Fellino</em> cut them off before they could choose a table, and he plain lied, flat out, claiming he was closed for business. “Come back tomorrow. and I will wait on you myself and serve you double shots of <em>grappa</em> for the price of one.” They protested, some, that they were thirsty, but double shots of <em>grappa</em> for the price of one was a fine offer, and they agreed they would return the next night.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> despised these people, he said, the big shots, who come down here to visit the grime of <em>Messina</em>, because they have heard stories of whores and cheap wine and <em>grappa</em>. Mostly for the whores, who are decent and work cheap and are good at what they do, so have been told and the cops never complain if the whores are roughed up because whores enjoy it.</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> asked on the whores re remembered from the old days.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> pounded his chest with a closed fist, “I am no <em>mezzano</em> (pimp).”</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> was confused. “Then you do not keep no whores here?” <em>Fellino</em> pounded his chest again.</p>
        <p>“Are you deaf? I said <em>Fellino</em> is no <em>mezzano</em>”</p>
        <p>“I meant no disrespect to you, but I remember…” <em>Fellino</em> stood and pushed his chair with such force it tipped and slid into the next table, that was empty. He righted the chair and mumbled about his temper, that he could no longer control his anger. He pounded the table.</p>
        <p>“I forbid any woman to be in here without a proper escort. Except, maybe an old woman no man would want. The whores show up when the <em>Marina Militare</em> is anchored in the harbor, but they pretend to be virtuous women. What can I say? We are in the same business. We sell what we have to sell. I sell <em>grappa</em> and wine. They sell…well, we are men of the world.” He straightened the sleeves on his shirt, that he had rolled up both arm.</p>
        <p>“We know what they sell,” he said. I smiled, uncomfortable, though, with talk of lose women, but flattered he saw me as a man of the world. I was not, but what did he know.</p>
        <p>“If you men are walking the streets, looking for a pleasant time, let me warn you these women prefer the company of officers.” He starred at <em>Luca</em> and laughed as he snapped a salute.</p>
        <p>“But you do not look like men who must pay for it…except, maybe this one,” as he looked direct at <em>Santo</em>, who sunk in the chair. “You are a quiet man,” <em>Fellino</em> said. “I have looked again, and I now believe you are not a man of the world. Let me ask you, when was your last time…if ever?” <em>Luca</em> laughed. I only smiled, as <em>Santo</em> is my cousin. “I am a married man,” he said, in his defense.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> laughed. “A joke, that’s all. Let an old man have his fun….no hard feelings.”</p>
        <p><em>Grazie Dio</em>, he did not ask me, and put me on the spot, as I am no <em>donnaiolo</em> (a womanizer, or cat hound) or would I admit it in front of other men. This talk of whores was uncomfortable and disrespectful to women, and I once swore an oath, I would never have a decent feeling for a dirty woman, and to think of a whore and think of <em>Carmela</em>, was blasphemy. There was a crucifix hanging behind the bar; I looked straight into the face of the crucified Christ, and I could feel my soul turning black. I knew I would burn in hell fire.</p>
        <p>I changed the subject, only to save my soul.</p>
        <p>“<em>Signuri Fellino</em>. Your brother? How did you get the news? That he was…was dead?” <em>Fellino</em> undid his arms, that were crossed at his chest, and he breathed deep, then grabbed the edge of the table, complaining the paint was tacky and not dry, that he would break the painter’s neck if he has the guts to come and face him, like a man.</p>
        <p>“I will tell you about my brother,” he says. “It will remind me of things I should forget, but you are a guest and a customer, and I have led you on with stories.”</p>
        <p>A bum, sleeping on a chair, his head against the wall, stirred, then woke and asked for a small glass of wine, to which <em>Fellino</em> said “<em>vai</em>, <em>vai</em>,” and ordered him out of the bar. He got up slowly and stumbled toward the side door, and struggled with the handle, saying he would never return because he was shown no respect. “<em>Vai</em>, <em>vai</em>,” <em>Fellino</em> walked toward the door. “A bum. No more, no less. Good riddance. He buys a glass of wine and thinks I am running a hotel.” He looked back at me. “What was your question?”</p>
        <p>“You brother. How did you find out about his death?”</p>
        <p>“<em>Si</em>, I was. <em>Giovanni</em>, my oldest brother, wrote the priest in our church, <em>Patri Mancini</em>, also a good customer, except for the women…wine and <em>grappa</em>, only. I remember the day. <em>Patri</em> come in…it was a quiet afternoon…we sat at the bar and drank wine. There was something on his mind I could see, because he always joked, but that day he was gloomy, quiet. I thought, maybe he is ill, from the bad water, or something like that. Then he says, out of nowhere, did I know that God works in strange ways? ‘Yes. You have said it many times,’ I answered, very respectfully. He patted my shoulder, like a good friend, not a priest and says he believes I am a man who can take bad news. At that instance I thought ‘who is dead.’ <em>Patri</em> made the sign of the cross and tells me, straight out, <em>Carmelo</em> was dead, murdered in the street, like a mad dog.” <em>Fellino</em> stopped his story to wipe his eyes, that were wet and red and swollen. His mother and father were dead, his brother <em>Carmelo</em> dead and <em>Giovanni</em> somewhere in America. <em>Fellino</em> had no wife, or children. No nothing.</p>
        <p>“The clothes on his back and the picture of our mother; it was all he brought to America, and a few <em>lire</em> he saved and a few <em>lire</em> I could spare. Business was bad for me. All the good drinkers were going to America. I had no more to give…if I did, maybe he would not be in the bad part of <em>Brukland</em>, and maybe he would be alive today. The bastards who did him in threw his empty wallet on the ground, opened to the picture of our mother staring at her dead son. They mocked him, even after he was dead, from their murder.”</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> cursed and shook his fist, and vowed revenge, even to that day; he admitted he had done nothing, or could he do anything because he was not the man he used to be.</p>
        <p>“Better my mother is dead, than know her son was shot down on some back street in some uncivilized place. I was glad she was dead and did not have to suffer through the death of her youngest son.”</p>
        <p><em>Santo</em> leaned to <em>Fellino</em> and touched his arm. “I will pray for your brother’s soul,” he said, and <em>Fellino</em> thanked him, and I believe they were both sincere.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> pointed to his knees. “Every day…every single day, for many years, I went to the Cathedral and prayed on my knees. Worn them to the bone, and what good did it do? He is still dead, and his murderers are free and spitting in my face. I admit for a time it gave me hope for justice and eased my pain. It was selfish of me, that I was praying to make myself feel better, no more. ‘Forgiveness,’ the priest says. I say, they should rot in hell, and the fire should be real and not some story, and it should burn their flesh for real and for all eternity.” He grabs at the edge of the table and squeezed; a vein in his neck swelled, looking likely to burst, though I have not ever seen it happen. He shook the table, rattling the glasses and the <em>grappa</em> spilled. “This anger, it is more at me because…” He stopped and pulled himself together, releasing his death grip on the table. He sat straight up. One the suspenders had slipped over his shoulder, and he pulled it back and smoothed the frayed collar of his white shirt.</p>
        <p>“I am angry with myself,” he said, so softly I leaned in close to hear what he said. “Angry that I was not with him when he died. After dying, what could be worse than dying alone? I would have killed those sonofabitchs with my two hands.” He made the motions of a man strangling another man; it sent chills down my arms as it seemed so real.</p>
        <p>“I am angry he is somewhere in a hole five thousand miles from his home. They threw him a ditch for all I know, like some dead dog found along the roadside. My brothers begged me to go with them, but I could not. I saw easy money, <em>soldi facili</em>, selling wine and whiskey to drunks. Now I detest the sight of them all, their smell, those dirty bastards. If I was there maybe, he would be alive today and I would not hate myself.” I saw the sorrow in his eyes, but he was still not a man I could respect. It was the whores I could get past.</p>
        <p>“<em>Scusa</em>,” he says and disappeared to the “back room,” as he called it, and all I thought, is that it was big enough for three men to stay the night, and what would he charge for that privilege? He come back in a few minutes, his white shirt soaked through, and I was certain he splashed water in his eyes. He fell onto the chair, like a sack of potatoes or onions had been dropped.</p>

        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Traitors and the Ferry</h3>

        <p><em>Luca</em> touched <em>Fellino’s</em> arm.</p>
        <p>“Maybe the cowardly men who murdered your brother have already paid.” <em>Fellino</em> laughed and <em>Luca</em> was embarrassed, and they both fidgeted with their hands.</p>
        <p>“Who pays for their sins?” he asks <em>Luca</em>. “Tell me this.” <em>Luca</em> stared, with nothing to say. “Name one man who has paid.” I could not, or <em>Santo</em> could not, or <em>Luca</em> could not.</p>
        <p>“If men thought they might pay, believe me, all of you, there would be no sin and my brother would not be dead.”</p>
        <p><em>Santo</em> cleared his throat. “God demands that all men pay for their sins.” Again, <em>Fellino</em> shook his head and laughed.</p>
        <p>“Name one, <em>signuri</em>. You are a little boy,” he said to <em>Santo</em>, “and I will not waste my time asking for your proof. All you will say is ‘<em>Patri</em> said this and <em>Patri</em> said that.’”</p>
        <p>We were quiet, and the bar was quiet, like a church at night, in the middle of the week. Not Sunday. When I thought on what <em>Fellino</em> said, it seemed someone, sometime, must have been called to account for his sins. Maybe not. What did I know, but what the priest tells me? This is all I know and in this <em>Fellino</em> is correct.</p>
        <p>He leaned forward in his chair. “My brother <em>Giovanni</em> has not written in years. Maybe he is dead, too, like <em>Carmelo</em>. He is there and I am here. What do I know? All I have is this goddamned bar, no children, no woman, no brothers, but drunks, day after day, night after night. A better man than me would have been on the next boat, if for nothing else than to bring his body home…to <em>Sicilia</em>, where he belongs.” He paused. “Or hang himself <em>Si</em>, a better man would have hung himself from an oak tree.”</p>
        <p>Three men, roustabouts, loud and poorly dressed, came in and demanded service. I expected <em>Fellino</em> would send them packing into the street; but no, he leads them to a table and respectfully took their order. Three men, two arms to a man. Six arms, all tattooed and displayed proudly. “Bring us wine and <em>salumi</em>,” the big one said, and <em>Fellino</em> brought wine, stale bread and olive oil, but no <em>salumi</em>. The big man, who the others called ‘<em>Enrico</em>,’ took a swig of the wine and dipped the hard bread into the olive oil. He ate it, then gagged on it; a fake gag, as I could tell, and he spit it to the floor, after swallowing the wine.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> stares at the mess and shook his head.</p>
        <p>“<em>Rifiuti</em> (garbage),” the smallest and a freak, says to <em>Fellino</em>. “Are you trying to poison us?”</p>
        <p>“I apologize to you men. The wine is <em>Sicilianu</em>, but it is old and maybe sour, but the olive oil is not <em>Sicilianu</em>, but <em>Calabrese</em>. What can I do? The army has all my good Sicilian wine and my Sicilian olive oil and fresh bread. They are off, into the hills chasing <em>briganti</em>.”</p>
        <p>“<em>Briganti</em> my ass,” the big man says, waving both arms, proudly showing his tattoo’s, then spit violently on the floors.</p>
        <p>“This <em>Calabrese</em> shit is no better than poison. Shit and piss mixed together must taste like this…we will pay over my dead body.” <em>Fellino</em> understood their anger, he says; no charge for the wine and the bread, but as inferior as it was, the roustabouts ate it all and drank it all, saying they might want more, as he had nothing better to offer. But free. On the house. No charge. <em>Gratuito</em>. What is better than free? Only life, itself. Every man knows this. <em>Fellino</em> did not agree or disagree, but bowed, slightly and returned to our table, all the time watching them from the corner of his eye.</p>
        <p>“They are pigs,” he said. “But I kiss their bare ass and say how good it smells.”</p>
        <p>“Why do you do it?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“They keep me open and going.” He looks across his bar. “They are the government, as bad as it is. The Army. The cops and the landowners. They run everything. Keep them happy and content, and you prosper. This island is like a great tub of water, but the water is slowly leaking through the cracks and now so many men and women leave, a few at a time, with their young, where will I be when the tub is empty? I blame the peasants.” He pulled on his ear, a sign that we should listen and learn from him. “And who is doing anything about it? No one. Maybe when some big general has a bug in his ass, or has been bribed, he will hold up the ferry to the mainland. I hear it might happen any day, but this is only rumor. I pray for the army, or other men with guns, to step in and plug the cracks.” He looked back at the sailors and gave them a short, mocking salute, and they toasted him with the free wine, while they ate the stale bread, that was also free.</p>
        <p>“<em>Cavones</em>,” <em>Fellino</em> says, quietly, under his breath, as he looks over his shoulder. “But <em>Fellino</em> will survive. <em>Fellino</em> will always survive. I have money, more than my share of property. And this place.” He looked around the room and smiled. “It is not much, but there will always be drunks, thank God, and low life who need whores.” He buttoned the top button of his white shirt and turned sideways in his chair. He was, I recall, a distinguished looking man, who might be confused with a banker if he wore a suit and a tie, or an undertaker if his suit was black.</p>
        <p>“But I would give it up, everything I have, just to stand in front of the man who killed my brother and I would strangle him with my bare hands.”</p>
        <p>A tall and wide shouldered sailor, a dark man, very dark, but not <em>Italiano</em>, came in and stood at the end of the bar. <em>Fellino</em> stood up, “we are closed,” he said to this dark-skinned man. “Come back another time.” This poor bastard seemed confused. As he sees three derelicts eating free food and drinking the free <em>grappa</em> and four at our table.</p>
        <p>“A small drink,” he says to <em>Fellino</em>, in pretty good <em>Italiano</em>. “You know better,” <em>Fellino</em> says, but not looking him in the eye.</p>
        <p>The poor bastard nods. ‘<em>Si</em>,” he said. “<em>Io so</em>.(I know). He left with no argument. <em>Fellino</em> waits until the door closes.</p>
        <p>“No <em>tizzuns</em> in here,” he says proudly, snapping his suspenders.</p>
        <p>It was the right thing to do, <em>Luca</em> said, and we all nodded. He was a stranger in my country; did he expect to be treated like a brother? It made sense to me. Then I spend fifty years in another man’s country, and I have not been treated like a brother, and looking back it made no sense to me.</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> leaned in, close to <em>Fellino’s</em> face. “You should go to America, <em>Fellino</em>. Find out where your brother is buried. That is the least you can do for …uh, for…”</p>
        <p>“<em>Carmelo</em>,” <em>Fellino</em> said, “My dead brother is <em>Carmelo</em>.” “<em>Si</em>, your brother <em>Carmelo</em> and… uh…”</p>
        <p>“<em>Giovanni</em> is my younger brother…I am the oldest.” “<em>Si</em>, your brothers <em>Carmelo</em> and <em>Giovanni</em>.”</p>
        <p>“<em>Grazie</em>,” <em>Fellino</em> answered. “But it is too late, my friends. Look at me. I am old, broken down. Nothing works as God intended it to work.” He leans across the table and shook his finger in <em>Luca’s</em> face. “Remember, you sonofabitches, this will happen to you some day if you are lucky enough to live as long as I have and seen as much as I have seen. And you,” pointing at <em>Luca</em>, “do not preach to me. I know what I should have done.” He pushed himself from the table and turned to the wall. We finished our drinks of fine <em>grappa</em> (it was fine)and pushed our glasses to the center of the table.</p>
        <p>“How far are we from the docks?” <em>Santo</em> asked me. “Two, three blocks, no more. It has been a while.”</p>
        <p>“I am worried, <em>Antonino</em>. It is dark. We have no place to sleep.”</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> pounded the tabletop. “Sleep? It is too early to think about sleep; maybe I want another drink, maybe two more drinks,” and he poured more <em>grappa</em>, while <em>Fellino</em> stared him down. The words were falling out of <em>Luca’s</em> mouth; his two eyes seemed to look in different directions. By my count he had five, maybe six <em>grappa’s</em>. I had one and <em>Santo</em> finished only half his glass. <em>Luca</em> was drunk, or almost drunk, and he will fight when he is drunk, or try to pick a fight and the size of his opponent, or their number made no difference. <em>Santo</em> wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his jacket. <em>Luca</em> pounded on the table, once again, and I see he was not as drunk as I thought.</p>
        <p>“We heard about this trouble on the docks,” he says to <em>Fellino</em>, who was nervous and squirmed like a fish on the hook. He shook his head.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> squints. “What are you talking about? What trouble? No trouble as far as I have heard…and I would know it if there was trouble.” <em>Luca</em> raised his glass to <em>Fellino</em>, more to mock him than show a show of respect.</p>
        <p>“A bad shooting, we heard. Or a plain murder. What was it? We heard it from a crazy old man back on the road.”</p>
        <p><em>Fellino’s</em> eyes lit up and his head bobbed up and down.</p>
        <p>“Ah, that thing. <em>Si</em>.<em>si</em>, but I was not there. But a business friend, <em>Giovanni Pastello</em> described it to me, but in no great detail. He is a man I trust, and I take what he says as true as the gospel.” He rolled the sleeve of his white shirt and scratched his arm, and the back of his neck, and he seemed uncomfortable, choosing his words like some bad politician in the <em>piazza</em>. “I recall the details, that were at thin.” <em>Fellino</em> clears his throat. “It seems my friend, <em>Pastello</em>, heard some soldier shot a man down, but they say he had it coming. A thief, I imagine, or worse, but I have no knowledge of this. He is dead…dead, like a dead dog. A shame there are men born to die that way,” and at that he bowed his head, and made the sign of the cross. “But it is nothing I am concerned with. You will admit it is none of my business what one man does to another, no matter how cruel.” He wiped beads of sweat from his forehead with a bar rag, complaining it was too hot for <em>Marzo</em>; that he had never seen a night in <em>Marzo</em> so hot, or ever this time of year.</p>
        <p>Where is the god damned breeze, he asked? He would open the window, for a breeze, but he was tired, a little *vertiginous* (dizzy)and asked if we would do him this favor. <em>Luca</em> struggled, the window was painted shut, but he managed to open the sash, and the breeze felt good. <em>Fellino</em> thanked him with a pat on the back, but <em>Luca</em> said he would prefer a round of <em>grappa</em>. <em>Fellino</em> smiled, and otherwise ignored the request.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> kicked the chair to rouse the sleeping bum who sat alone.</p>
        <p>The bum, his hand still holding the glass for dear life, coughed and snorted, but did not awake, or respond to the kick and <em>Fellino</em> cursed him, but let him alone.</p>
        <p>“Look at this dead man, this cold corpse, if he is not a customer, what is my interest in him, as it has cost me nothing or profited me nothing and I will kick his dead carcass into the street”</p>
        <p>He scratched his fingers across the tabletop where we sat, back and forth, and I hear his feet shuffle over the grit on the floor, that had not been swept in a while. Finally, after a time of silence, <em>Fellino</em> laughed and slapped the tabletop. “Come on,” he said, “It is a joke and nothing more. Of course, I regret the death of any man, even a goddamned thief, if he was a thief and not a plain troublemaker, as <em>Sicilia</em> has more than her share of troublemakers, these days.” A sailor asleep at the bar snored, and <em>Fellino</em> shifted in his chair, complaining again on the drunks and derelicts he was forced to serve to make a decent living. Maybe he should have gone to America, but then, maybe, he would be dead like his brother, <em>Carmelo</em>. <em>Forse</em>, <em>forse</em>.</p>
        <p>He pushed the bottle to <em>Luca</em>. “More <em>grappa</em>?” <em>Luca</em> held out his glass.</p>
        <p>“<em>Certo</em>,” he said, and <em>Fellino</em> poured, but his hand shook, and he spilled a shot, maybe two, on the table. He cursed and apologized, saying it was not like him to waste good <em>grappa</em>. <em>Fellino</em> was born to pour <em>grappa</em>, as I could see, and to own a bar and complain about drunks, while getting rich in a country that was dying. He took away the first bottle, that was empty, and put the second in the middle of the table. A sign, I thought, we were welcome to help ourselves. This pleased <em>Luca</em>, I see by the smile on his face.</p>
        <p>“This shooting worries you?” <em>Fellino</em> asked, staring from the corner of his eye. “It worries us,” I said. “It was a killing, not a shooting.”</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> laughed. “The shooting, <em>scusa</em>. So, the killing of a derelict worries you? A thief, no doubt, who was disrespectful to a trigger-happy cop and pissed him off. Thieves are like fleas here, and you swat fleas to rid yourself of their nuisance.”</p>
        <p><em>Santo</em> made the sign of the cross. “This is no way to speak of a dead man.”</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> leaned into the center of the table, and starred at <em>Santo’s</em> eyes. “A word of advice, my friend. These hotheaded <em>Carabinieri</em> shoot first and if they are wrong, sometimes they apologize. Not always. This is the way of world. What can I do about it?” Why a riot? Who fights when a thief is killed? Not in <em>Sicilia</em>. No. The cops were there to stop these people from leaving. I coughed, and <em>Fellino</em> turned, and we stared at each other. Why did <em>Fellino</em> lie, if he did lie? I spoke first, with information that was not from a good source.</p>
        <p>“We hear men in the street jawing, saying the cops stopped the ferry from leaving, and that is why the riot. Taking passports, pushing men around and a poor bastard decided he would fight…maybe he was drunk. Now he is dead. Now we hear the ferry to <em>Calabria</em> is canceled for a full week, to keep the farm labor working, as the owners were complaining to the government. Is this the truth, <em>signuri</em>?” We heard no such thing on the street, but always in the back of my mind I worried this would happen, that we would come this far only to be stopped by the law. <em>Fellino</em> shifts in his seat and waived his finger in the air.</p>
        <p>“I do not concern myself with these matters. Politics is of no interest to me.” He stood up and backed off a few steps and curled his lips.</p>
        <p>“But, uh…I recall, now that you mention it. There was talk the cops went to stop the ferry, but there was too much blood. <em>Sangue</em>. These weak-kneed politicians hate <em>sangue</em>. But to soothe your fears, I hear the ferry is running again, but who knows for how long? For me, I believe they had good reason. The <em>contadini</em> (peasants) are like hungry wolves, fighting over the same piece of rotting meat. Hordes of men, all leaving at the same time. Important men, powerful men, are only worrying about their own interests. Can you blame them? They are the hammers that drive the nails into the wood, that keeps everything together, but they must never know it. Never. I said “never” tell a peasant he has any value. He gets lazy. Refuses to work. Talks back. Wants things to be better. And who pays? But I do not count you men among the rabble. You see what you want and you go get it.” An oil lamp flickered and went out, the black smoke curling toward the ceiling. <em>Fellino</em> was angry. He pounded the tabletop, and the shot glasses bounced, and some <em>grappa</em> spilled. He complained about his good for nothing <em>bidello</em> (janitor) who has threatened to quit for America and did not show to fill the lamps as he was ordered. “Maybe he went with the waiter,” and we laughed. <em>Fellino</em> said neither man owed him anything, as both worked for a wage, so what did they care if the lights go out, or the customers were not served their drinks; he claimed to understand why his men left for America, but he hated them for it.</p>
        <p>“What about me?” he kept asking, as if there was an answer to be found.</p>
        <p>A man and a woman showed at the side door; at the threshold the man yells, “Do you have food to spare?” He had no money, swearing he would work hard to pay for the cost of what they ate. “We will not take a handout,” he said. “We will starve first.” That very day, he refused a handout from the Church, though his wife is sick, in need of food and water. She will work, too, he said, if that is what <em>Fellino</em> demands. <em>Fellino</em> shakes his head. “<em>Vai</em>, <em>vai</em>,” he said. “I have no food to give away. Am I a charity?” The man became angry and loud, reminding <em>Fellino</em> they wanted no handout, and would only take food if they could work off the cost.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> shooed the man away, like a cat is shooed. “<em>Si</em>, <em>si</em>, no charity. I misspoke. <em>Mi dispiace</em>. But I have no food, for any reason. Take her to the bar down the street. Ask for <em>Pulliotti</em>. He may have food, because the army refuses to buy from him.” <em>Fellino</em> points a finger in the man’s face. “But I warn you, he will hold a gun to your head, and wrench a day’s work out of both of you for a few crumbs of stale bread and dirty water. He is the worst kind of thief, but he has food.” The woman, now weeping, took a step closer to <em>Fellino</em>, but the man grabbed her by the arm and lead her to the door. She stopped and turned around, “<em>Grazie</em>, <em>signuri</em>,” she said to no one in particular, and they left. I cannot swear on this, as the poor women did not turn directly to me, but I believe she was expecting a child, and it is certain <em>Fellino</em> saw her condition from his seat at the table.</p>
        <p>“<em>Buona liberazione</em>,” he said, once the door closed behind the two. “Good riddance to both of them. I cannot be bothered…riff raff.”</p>
        <p>“I believe she is expecting a child,” I said. “Was it right to send her away?”</p>
        <p>“It is of no concern to me, but yes, she was. What proof do I have they were married? Too much immorality in <em>Sicilia</em> today. We need a strong man and a strong Church to guide our country.” He poured a <em>grappa</em>, sipping it slowly, like a conqueror, maybe <em>Garibaldi</em>. “Now…what was I was saying before this riff raff interrupted? <em>Si</em>, <em>si</em>. Who will do the harvest if all the peasants are let to chase a dream?” He pounded his chest with a closed fist.</p>
        <p>“What will happen to me?”</p>
        <p>He had pointed to the drunk, whose head was laying in his own vomit, but I do not believe he was dead, “Or him, for whatever he is worth. How will he eat and who will sell me food? I will be out of business.”</p>
        <p>“What about us,” <em>Santo</em> asked. “Who worries about us?” <em>Luca</em> agreed.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> leaned across the table. “You men are traitors, all of you,” he said, pointing at each of us in turn, starting with me. “You abandon this country and your families. No better than traitors as far as I am concerned.” <em>Luca</em> slapped the tabletop.</p>
        <p>“Your brothers? What about your brothers? They left <em>Sicilia</em>. Are they traitors?”</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> just stared at <em>Luca</em>, not answering him, as the answer was clear, and no explanation was needed. He leans back and snaps his suspenders, for the hundredth time.</p>
        <p>“I see I have insulted you men. Of course, do as you see fit.” He excused himself, took a rag from the bar and wiped down a few of the empty tables. I apologize to <em>Fellino</em>, as a nothing but a courtesy, as we were in his place of business, and not that I was concerned with <em>Luca’s</em> question, that was a good question and deserved an answer.</p>
        <p>“Do not be concerned you have offended me,” he said, “but I am an old man and time offends me many times a day, every day.” He was sad in the eyes, maybe thinking better days are long since gone for him. He pointed to each of the four corners in the room.</p>
        <p>“This is my life, drunks and other disreputable people…my world.” He smiled and patted my shoulder. “But you men…I envy you some. Even the crazy one.” Did he mean <em>Santo</em> or <em>Luca</em>, who was near asleep on the table for all the <em>grappa</em> he drank. Thank God.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> put his finger to my nose, not touching me, but nearly.</p>
        <p>“I would close the doors in a minute and go where I criticize you men for going. But I am old, too old. I only think about yesterday, never tomorrow. One brother paid the price, and he is dead, <em>morte</em>, God rest his soul. The other? Who knows? Maybe he is dead. I am angry for my many faults. I have always been a coward…not like you men, I hate you all but envy you all, your youth, your guts…fuck men like me…you are doing the right thing.” He patted his forehead with the bar rag, then threw it across the room, knocking some glasses off the bar, breaking at least two, and the chards spread across the floor. He cursed his lack of self-control, and cursed the broken glasses, as if the pieces had a life of their own. It was time to leave. Our bill? What did we owe for the <em>grappa</em>, if it was not on the house? Did he say it was on the house? <em>Signuri Fellino</em>, I am sorry to say this, was worse off for our visit. He was staring at the ceiling, mumbling words I could not hear, and soon, very soon, he was asleep, or he pretended to be asleep. We were leaving, so I touched his shoulder to wake him and he gave a startled jump.</p>
        <p>“<em>Mi dispiace</em>. Did I doze off?” He coughed. “I tire too quick these days.” “No, no. You were wide awake,” I said. “But I have a question.”</p>
        <p>“Anything,” he said, as we walked to the door, his hand on my arm. “You say the ferries are running again to <em>Calabria</em>?”</p>
        <p>“<em>Si</em>. Two a day,” he said without much thought. “<em>Si</em>. Two, I have been told, but who knows tomorrow? There were four a day, but the law, these goddamn cops, they live in the landowners back pocket. Men like me mean nothing anymore, <em>niente</em>. As I say, these ferries are canceled on a whim.” For the first time I notice he was taller than me, taller than any of us, and I thought, why did I not see this before, except he walked with a stoop, that made him look old and sickly and weak. “Like an ape,” <em>Luca</em> later said. A man rattled the door, but <em>Fellino</em> held the knob and him away. “We are closed. Come back tomorrow or go to <em>Puliotti’s</em> down the street.” He checks the lock to see its latched.</p>
        <p>“Another drunk. Just another goddamned drunk.”</p>
        <p>I asked this question, hoping he would offer us his back room for the night. “Is there a place we can sleep, where no one will bother us. We have no spare money to rent a room.”</p>
        <p>“Where no one with bother you?” <em>Fellino</em> laughed.</p>
        <p>“My friend. This is <em>Sicilia</em>. You are fair game for anyone with nothing better to do, as long as they might have a stick.” He took my hand, patted it gently, almost caressing it, like a mother would soothe her child. “Stay in the woods. The woods are free. And anyway, three strong men such as yourself, who will bother you?” He patted at my shoulder. “I no longer take in boarders since some derelict half beat his whore to death upstairs, or, believe me, I would put you up for the night. But there is a house I know, on <em>Via Parma</em>, a few blocks from here. They have rooms, not free rooms, and I am sure you did not expect it free,” and with his heavy voice he his weight on the word “free,” and I realize, he thinks we are asking for a handout.</p>
        <p>“No, of course not, I am sure it’s not free.” I was a fool, and I stuttered and could not wait to get out of his sight.</p>
        <p>“Uh…what do we owe for the drinks?” He smiles.</p>
        <p>“For my friends…one <em>lira</em>, and I give you a break. It has been my pleasure to meet men such as yourself. But should you get to America, make a toast to my brothers if you have the time.” I admit this, I did not like <em>Fellino</em>, and at any other time I would not spend a cent in his bar, but I did the right thing and I thanked him for his generosity.</p>
        <p>“But do me this favor,” he said, “And I will pay you back when you come this way again. Should you see my brother <em>Giovanni</em>, <em>Giovanni Fellino</em>,” he set his right hand at eye level, “a <em>Siclianu</em> man about this tall with green eyes, like two emeralds. Tell him to write his brother.”</p>
        <p>No…tell him to come home. Tell him his brother misses him and he is sorry, very sorry. Please tell him that.” I do not know what he was the day before we met, but that day he was a lonely and desperate man, for a reason to get up in the morning, except to serve drunks and derelicts, as he called them. I saw myself in him, and it was a frightening thing, and I began to sweat and my heart beat fast.</p>
        <p>I wondered what he was sorry for, but I refused to ask. He follows us to the door. “Should you fail, my friends, and my right hand to God, I hope you do not. But if you fail, if you come back broke and with no money to eat, stop by and see <em>Fellino</em>. I will give you <em>grappa</em> and feed you dinner. But do not wait, the clock is ticking; faster for me than you.” I thanked him and <em>Santo</em> thanked him, but not <em>Luca</em>, saying there is no reason for him to speak of such generosity, as we would not be back.</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> smiles. “But if you do and I am dead, not here anymore, visit my grave; say a small prayer for me. I will be next to the <em>Chiesa di Santa Rosa</em>, on <em>Via Umberto</em>, relaxing for eternity. I hope under an oak tree, as it has always been a pleasant thought for me.”</p>
        <p>“I will say a prayer,” <em>Santo</em> said, “and I am not ashamed, and it will be an honor.” “I will toast you and your brothers,” <em>Luca</em> said. “But that is all…I will not pray.”</p>
        <p><em>Fellino</em> laughed. “<em>Grazie</em>, all of you. I hope to be here, as it is always better than not being here.” He laughed, again. “Always better.” We shook hands and he wished <em>buona fortuna</em>.</p>
        <p>“Forget my bitterness. Never let angry men, like me, deny you the pursuit of a better life.” He follows us onto the cobblestone street, and we walked a short way together.</p>
        <p>“God speed,” he said. “<em>Ci vediamo</em>, until the next time.” “Point us to the ferry,” I asked, as he walked away.</p>
        <p>“You are already pointed in the right direction, my friends. Follow your nose. The smell. Those goddamned fish.”</p>
