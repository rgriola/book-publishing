        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Stubborn Goat and the Delayed Train</h3>

        <p>The old man cursed the filthy animal, as he pulled hard on the rope, but his goat, like all goats was stubborn, and refused to move. Disgusted, or tired, I figured, he dropped the rope to the ground. He looked me straight in the eyes. “You men will have a long wait for the train.” It was hot and humid and dusty, and it seemed he might be crazy, so I politely nodded, but otherwise ignored him and sat myself under the tree. But he said it again.</p>
        <p>“You men will have a long wait for the train,” annoyed that I did not answer him. Was it his business?</p>
        <p>“I say you men…”</p>
        <p>“<em>Si</em>, <em>si</em>,” I answered, only to shut him up. “That is why we are here at the stop, waiting for the train.” I was not in a mood for questions from an old man in rags, who smelled worse than his goat, and looked as bad. They both needed a good meal, but I only felt sorry for the goat.</p>
        <p>“You will be here until hell freezes,” he said. “And I hear it never freezes.” “Hell freezes? What do you mean?”</p>
        <p>He grinned, a happy look, taking pleasure in giving me the bad news. The mail rider from <em>Ragusa</em> reported the train was raided by <em>briganti</em>, who came rode down from the mountains, on good horses (likely stolen), firing guns, threatening to kill any resistor. They murdered the engineer and a few passengers, who were armed, and too foolish to surrender.</p>
        <p>“Fools,” the old man said, spitting juice on the ground. “Fools, plain and simple. A real shame.” The old man sighed; “killed for a few <em>lire</em>,” but otherwise he showed no emotion, no pity, no outrage. “Only fools resist. When a gun is shoved up your ass, the only way to survive is surrender.” He was sure of it. It was the rule he lived by, though he admitted he never had a gun shoved in his ass, or anywhere else. The engineer should have surrendered, too, the fool. This he said loud enough that every man at the tree heard him and realized the train was not coming. I counted nine men at the tree: six men already there and the three of us. I refused to include the old man, or his goat. When the six heard the train was not coming, they argued among themselves, and each man offered an opinion as to what they should do. It was not a violent argument, but loud and annoying, and finally they agreed nothing goes right when there is a chance it can go wrong. I believe this to be true. These god damned <em>briganti</em> were bold, more bold and violent than just a few years ago. It is my belief they steal and kill as much for the fun of it, as to survive. Survival. This I understand. Only a great man, or a good priest would not kill to survive. Who are the great men and where are they?</p>

        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Threat of the Bandits</h3>

        <p>“Never resist or fight back,” is the rule and a wise rule. “I surrender.” How simple it is to say, and they will respect you and not kill you, except the ones who kill for fun. The best of these <em>briganti</em>, I have been told, will clean out a train, an engine and four cars in ten minutes. The army will chase them, capture a few, and kill a few more, but mostly they roam free in the mountains to rob who they please, when they please.</p>
        <p>“The train…it may not rule for a few days,” the old man said. “I saw it in ’03. What is left of the crew will fear for their lives, but the goddamned army will not guarantee their safety.” He looked to me, his face and hands shaking from the curse of old age. Now he laughed. “What will you men do? If you wait, you will wait under the tree ‘til Christmas.” He grabs his rope off the ground and pulled hard on it, cursing his goat to hell.</p>
        <p>“Then we will walk,” I said, and I believed <em>Santo</em> and <em>Luca</em> would be with me.</p>
        <p>“Walk? <em>buona fortuna</em>,” the old man said. “If your friends agree to this, then you are all crazy. They bandits will rob you for your laces and kill you for the fun of it.”</p>
        <p>It was twenty odd miles from the oak tree to the docks in <em>Messina</em>. The distance I guessed as no one in the crowd knew, or they would not say (tell nothing to no one). Everything is a secret in <em>Sicilia</em>. Everything. But I recalled, from army days, the road was in fair shape, hard packed dirt and small cobblestone, good for horses and mules and wagons, not good for legs and feet. The road follows along the turns of the sea, then at a point along the way, maybe half there, it wanders inland a quarter of a mile, or so. Trees and good hiding along the way.</p>
        <p>My worry? Not the legs, that are young enough to stand the pounding, but we are in a violent and lawless country. The old men say thieves and other <em>briganti</em> roam free in the mountains and on the roads, and they are bold, and will battle even the army if challenged.</p>

        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Tragedy of the Dell’ Unto Brothers</h3>

        <p>Sometimes it is not possible to tell law and the <em>briganti</em> apart, when they look the same and act the same. I can say, and I am honest about this claim, there is no fair law in <em>Sicilia</em>. Two years ago, the <em>briganti</em> raided my village, and the truth is embarrassing, that we had nothing of value to give up and they agreed, saying we should rob with them, as partners. On this trip, every desperate man with a horse or a mule, and a stick for a gun, will try to get a piece of us, hoping we carry a pocketful of <em>lire</em> (we are not) so the joke will be on these bastards. Me? I saved a few <em>lire</em> for the trip, that I have well hidden in my pack. I am afraid these crooks, these bastards, will smell it like a wolf smells the blood of a wounded animal. I should go home and try another time, as the signs, so far, are all bad, but it is only some hours to <em>Messina</em> to catch a ferry and the train to <em>Napoli</em>. I heard the story of the thirteen men from <em>Bianco</em> in <em>Reggio di Calabria</em>, who walked four days to <em>Napoli</em>, to catch the boat for America, for no reason but that they were all broke. Busted. No wealth, but for their ticket to America. They walked in the daylight, hiding in the trees at night. Sixteen men and boys at the start, but two missed their home so much, they turned back, and one came up sick and lame, and could not go on. He stayed in the woods and was never seen again. By the time the thirteen reached <em>Napoli</em>. There were eight, and the rest were lost, or not accounted for. This is a story, but I believe it to be true. The fare to America is cheaper from <em>Palermu</em>, I have been told, but as I see it, only a fool would travel through these mountains without ten armed men by his side. If you beat the <em>briganti</em>, who number like the trees in the forest, there are the packs of wolves and mountain cats, that forage at the night. The <em>Dell’ Unto</em> brothers tried it, a few years back, at Christmas time, believing they would save a few <em>lire</em> and be ahead of the rest when they landed in America. <em>Briganti</em> took them on the first day, as they were easy to beat, as they knew nothing about the world off the mountain. Four bastards, on fast horses, came out of the woods and took the boys by surprise. The two ran in different directions, hoping to confuse the <em>briganti</em>, but in the end, each was run down and pinned against a different tree, begging for their lives, while they made the sign of the cross and called on <em>Santo Rocco</em>. Who was there to listen or care? The <em>briganti</em> demanded money; it was their right to steal, they said, and the threat was a bullet in the face. <em>Giovanni</em> was the youngest, the one I knew best; he handed over a few <em>lire</em> and a gold watch he won in a card game the week before leaving home. The older boy, <em>Orazio</em>, who always played hero, claimed he was broke and starving and had no money to give up. They were forced to undress and listen to the jokes the <em>briganti</em> made about the boy’s manhood. Nothing was found nothing on <em>Giovanni</em>, but <em>Orazio</em> had twenty <em>lire</em> in coins hidden in a secret pocket sewn by his mother, just for a time like this. The <em>briganti</em>, annoyed by the lies, took pleasure by beating him sound with a club and the barrel of a revolver. Naked, <em>Giovanni</em> crawls to help his brother, but to no good end. As <em>Orazio</em> fought one thief, the other put a bullet in his head, and <em>Orazio</em> falls, lifeless, to the ground, and the <em>briganti</em> took turns spitting on his body. <em>Giovanni</em> was allowed to live, but as a price for coming to his brother’s aid, he was beaten one more time.</p>
        <p>“Take this message back to your village,” they tell <em>Giovanni</em>, who was near dead, “If anyone resists, they die. We are not killers, but businessmen. Stealing is our business.”</p>
        <p>The next morning, an old chestnut picker, stopped to take a piss and found the boys off the side of the road. <em>Giovanni</em> was curled in a ball, still calling for his dead brother to help him. The <em>briganti</em> were gone, of course, like smoke in a wind, and I am certain they lived well on the coins and bought what they needed, including a bullet to replace the one they shot into <em>Orazio’s</em> head. <em>Giovanni</em> wept like a child, he was beaten so bad, that he lasted only a few days, but long enough to tell the old man all four <em>briganti</em> wore parts of an army uniform: a shirt, a hat or an insignia. The <em>Dell’ Unto</em> family and their clan in <em>Sicilia</em>, over a hundred, swore to God they would not rest until the bastards were dead and their families suffered like they suffered. This promise made them feel good, like men, but I hear to this day not one of the <em>Dell’ Unto</em> family has spent an hour searching for the murderers. The boys’ father died from a broken heart a few months after they were buried, <em>Giovanni</em> on top of <em>Orazio</em>. The father often spoke of vengeance until the day he took his last breath. For this reason, we did not take the road, across the mountains, to <em>Palermu</em>, just to save a few <em>lire</em>.</p>

        <!-- Section 4: Luca's Previous Adventure -->
        <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">Luca's Uncompromising Vow</h3>

        <p>The forest of oaks along the <em>Messina</em> Road made for good cover should we needed it, God help us. <em>Luca</em> is a tough and unforgiving man, with his own rules, and I have not seen another man best him in anything physical. He vows he will not hide in the woods, like a scared farmer would do, or a woman with children, and to this he will not compromise. <em>Luca</em> has traveled this way before, with <em>Camillo</em>, his older brother, who is a wiser, and some say a tougher man, but I have not seen him fight, so I cannot say. Three or four years ago, the brothers worked together, in <em>Masserti’s</em> lemon orchard; at almost the same breath, they decided picking lemons for an <em>assole</em> like <em>Masserti</em> was not in their plan. They took a walk for adventure, as they claimed to be bored with the quiet of the farms (adventure, to them, was wine and <em>puttanu</em> and fighting). They abandoned the ladders, left their tools and started for the great cities of <em>Sicilia</em>: <em>Messina</em>, <em>Palermu</em>, maybe <em>Marsala</em>, two hundred miles away. “A fool’s trip,” I said, when they ask me to come along, but I did what they wanted and told them it seemed like a good thing for them to do. Why go? I had work, I said, but it was a bold lie, and <em>Luca</em> knew it, but he understood. In less than two weeks they were back, beaten and bloodied, cursing and complaining about their life on the road and every village they saw, every man and women they met, and their children. They never spoke about the trip, or did they admit to some fault or bad judgment, but after a good bottle of wine, <em>Luca</em> admitted the truth. Drunk on stolen wine, as they staggered on this very road, their only worry an empty bottle, and suddenly and from behind, they were set on by four men on foot, who walked softly, like cats, and pounced like mountain lions. They struggled with the <em>briganti</em>, fighting hard until they saw an opening and headed for the woods, but they went too far and too fast and <em>Luca</em> near died when he slipped on slime that covered the rocks and fell into the sea, as if thrown there by the hand of God. Drowning in the freezing water, he struggled against the waves, while begging God, or his brother, or someone else, to save him. <em>Camillo</em> dove into the waves and kept <em>Luca’s</em> head above water, until they made it to a pile of rock about a hundred feet offshore. The <em>briganti</em> are businessmen first, and refused to go into the water, as what did they see, but two dirt farmers shivering on the rocks. Once they decided to plain kill <em>Luca</em> and <em>Camillo</em>, and each <em>brigand</em> emptied his revolver (nothing more than old belly guns), near hitting <em>Luca</em> twice and grazing <em>Camillo’s</em> right shoulder. After a while the <em>briganti</em> tired of the sport, cursed the two and swore they would rob and kill them another day. <em>Camillo</em> and <em>Luca</em> passed the night on the rocks, near drowning at high tide, but they managed to get back to shore, hiding in the trees until their strength was back, when they headed straight home and swore not to utter a word of their trip, so as not to disgrace themselves in the village. I am not a coward, as it might seem to some, or the hero all men want to be, but somewhere in the middle of the two. I do not understand heroism, or men who are heroes, but I understand why <em>Luca</em> refuses to hide in the woods.</p>

        <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Final Push to the Ferry</h3>

        <p>The long walk to <em>Messina</em>, maybe ten or twelve hours to the docks after dark, did not set well with me. The docks are dangerous at night, the worst of all characters hang there; <em>briganti</em> and other thieves, and drunks, whoremongers, and plain troublemakers. I was there in the army, and I remember it well, but it is the only way to get the boat for <em>Calabria</em>. What choice did we have? The ferry runs early in the morning, if it runs, but our news from the city is old and discouraging. The docks will be crowded with <em>Siciliani</em> trying to leave for anywhere, America, Argentina, even Brazil. Any place life is better than here. If we miss the ferry, we miss the train and we miss the boat and our tickets will be worthless paper, only good to wipe a dirty ass.</p>
