    <!-- Train Raided, Walk to Messina

The train is delayed by a briganti raid, forcing the men to walk 20 dangerous miles to Messina, fearing robbers and lawlessness.-->
<div class="chapter-body">

<p class="calibre4">The old man cursed the filthy animal, as he pulled hard on the rope, but his goat, like all goats was stubborn, and refused to move. Disgusted, or tired, I figured, he dropped the rope to the ground. He looked me straight in the eyes. “You men will have a long wait for the train.” It was hot and humid and dusty, and it seemed he might be crazy, so I politely nodded, but otherwise ignored him and sat myself under the tree. But he said it again.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You men will have a long wait for the train,” annoyed that I did not answer him. Was it his business?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I say you men…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, si,” I answered, only to shut him up. “That is why we are here at the stop, waiting for the train.” I was not in a mood for questions from an old man in rags, who smelled worse than his goat, and looked as bad. They both needed a good meal, but I only felt sorry for the goat.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You will be here until hell freezes,” he said. “And I hear it never freezes.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hell freezes? What do you mean?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He grinned, a happy look, taking pleasure in giving me the bad news. The mail rider from <i class="calibre5">Ragusa</i> reported the train was raided by <i class="calibre5">briganti,</i> who came rode down from the mountains, on good horses (likely stolen), firing guns, threatening to kill any resistor. They murdered the engineer and a few passengers, who were armed, and too foolish to surrender.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Fools,” the old man said, spitting juice on the ground. “Fools, plain and simple. A real shame.” The old man sighed; “killed for a few lire,” but otherwise he showed no emotion, no pity, no outrage. “Only fools resist. When a gun is shoved up your ass, the only way to survive is surrender.” He was sure of it. It was the rule he lived by, though he admitted he never had a gun shoved in his ass, or anywhere else. The engineer should have surrendered, too, the fool. This he said loud enough that every man at the tree heard him and realized the train was not coming. I counted nine men at the tree: six men already there and the three of us. I refused to include the old man, or his goat. When the six heard the train was not coming, they argued among themselves, and each man offered an opinion as to what they should do. It was not a violent argument, but loud and annoying, and finally they agreed nothing goes right when there is a chance it can go wrong. I believe this to be true. These god damned <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> were bold, more bold and violent than just a few years ago. It is my belief they steal and kill as much for the fun of it, as to survive. Survival. This I understand. Only a great man, or a good priest would not kill to survive. Who are the great men and where are they?      </p>
<p id="page_224" class="calibre6"> “Never resist or fight back,” is the rule and a wise rule. “I surrender.” How simple it is to say, and they will respect you and not kill you, except the ones who kill for fun. The best of these <i class="calibre5">briganti, </i>I have been told, will clean out a train, an engine and four cars in ten minutes. The army will chase them, capture a few, and kill a few more, but mostly they roam free in the mountains to rob who they please, when they please.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The train…it may not rule for a few days,” the old man said.  “I saw it in ’03. What is left of the crew will fear for their lives, but the goddamned army will not guarantee their safety.” He looked to me, his face and hands shaking from the curse of old age. Now he laughed. “What will you men do? If you wait, you will wait under the tree ‘til Christmas.” He grabs his rope off the ground and pulled hard on it, cursing his goat to hell.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then we will walk,” I said, and I believed Santo and Luca would be with me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Walk? <i class="calibre5">buona fortuna</i>,” the old man said. “If your friends agree to this, then you are all crazy. They bandits will rob you for your laces and kill you for the fun of it.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was twenty odd miles from the oak tree to the docks in Messina. The distance I guessed as no one in the crowd knew, or they would not say (tell nothing to no one). Everything is a secret in Sicilia. Everything. But I recalled, from army days, the road was in fair shape, hard packed dirt and small cobblestone, good for horses and mules and wagons, not good for legs and feet. The road follows along the turns of the sea, then at a point along the way, maybe half there, it wanders inland a quarter of a mile, or so.  Trees and good hiding along the way.        </p>
<p id="page_225" class="calibre6">My worry? Not the legs, that are young enough to stand the pounding, but we are in a violent and lawless country. The old men say thieves and other <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> roam free in the mountains and on the roads, and they are bold, and will battle even the army if challenged. Sometimes it is not possible to tell law and the <i class="calibre5">briganti </i>apart<i class="calibre5">,</i> when they look the same and act the same. I can say, and I am honest about this claim, there is no fair law in Sicilia. Two years ago, the <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> raided my village, and the truth is embarrassing, that we had nothing of value to give up and they agreed, saying we should rob with them, as partners. On this trip, every desperate man with a horse or a mule, and a stick for a gun, will try to get a piece of us, hoping we carry a pocketful of lire (we are not) so the joke will be on these bastards. Me? I saved a few lire for the trip, that I have well hidden in my pack. I am afraid these crooks, these bastards, will smell it like a wolf smells the blood of a wounded animal. I should go home and try another time, as the signs, so far, are all bad, but it is only some hours to Messina to catch a ferry and the train to Napoli. I heard the story of the thirteen men from <i class="calibre5">Bianco</i> in <i class="calibre5">Reggio di Calabria</i>, who walked four days to Napoli, to catch the boat for America, for no reason but that they were all broke. Busted. No wealth, but for their ticket to America. They walked in the daylight, hiding in the trees at night. Sixteen men and boys at the start, but two missed their home so much, they turned back, and one came up sick and lame, and could not go on. He stayed in the woods and was never seen again. By the time the thirteen reached Napoli. There were eight, and the rest were lost, or not accounted for. This is a story, but I believe it to be true. The fare to America is cheaper from Palermu, I have been told, but as I see it, only a fool would travel through these mountains without ten armed men by his side. If you beat the <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>, who number like the trees in the forest, there are the packs of wolves and mountain cats, that forage at the night. The Dell’ Unto brothers tried it, a few years back, at Christmas time, believing they would save a few lire and be ahead of the rest when they landed in America. <i class="calibre5">Briganti</i> took them on the first day, as they were easy to beat, as they knew nothing about the world off the mountain. Four bastards, on fast horses, came out of the woods and took the boys by surprise. The two ran in different directions, hoping to confuse the <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>, but in the end, each was run down and pinned against a different tree, begging for their lives, while they made the sign of the cross and called on <i class="calibre5">Santo Rocco</i>. Who was there to listen or care? The <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> demanded money; it was their right to steal, they said, and the threat was a bullet in the face. <i>Giovanni</i> was the youngest, the one I knew best; he handed over a few lire and a gold watch he won in a card game the week before leaving  home. The older boy, <i>Orazio</i>, who always played hero, claimed he was broke and starving and had no money to give up. They were forced to undress and listen to the jokes the briganti made about the boy’s manhood. Nothing was found nothing on Giovanni, but Orazio had twenty lire in coins hidden in a secret pocket sewn by his mother, just for a time like this. The <i class="calibre5">briganti, </i>annoyed by the lies, took pleasure by beating him sound with a club and the barrel of a revolver. Naked, Giovanni crawls to help his brother, but to no good end. As Orazio fought one thief, the other put a bullet in his head, and Orazio falls, lifeless, to the ground, and the <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> took turns spitting on his body. Giovanni was allowed to live, but as a price for coming to his brother’s aid, he was beaten one more time.     </p>
<p id="page_227" class="calibre6">“Take this message back to your village,” they tell Giovanni, who was near dead, “If anyone resists, they die. We are not killers, but businessmen. Stealing is our business.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The next morning, an old chestnut picker, stopped to take a piss and found the boys off the side of the road. Giovanni was curled in a ball, still calling for his dead brother to help him. The <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> were gone, of course, like smoke in a wind, and I am certain they lived well on the coins and bought what they needed, including a bullet to replace the one they shot into Orazio’s head. Giovanni wept like a child, he was beaten so bad, that he lasted only a few days, but long enough to tell the old man all four <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> wore parts of an army uniform: a shirt, a hat or an insignia. The Dell’ Unto family and their clan in Sicilia, over a hundred, swore to God they would not rest until the bastards were dead and their families suffered like they suffered. This promise made them feel good, like men, but I hear to this day not one of the Dell’ Unto family has spent an hour searching for the murderers. The boys’ father died from a broken heart a few months after they were buried, Giovanni on top of Orazio.  The father often spoke of vengeance until the day he took his last breath. For this reason, we did not take the road, across the mountains, to Palermu, just to save a few lire. </p>
<p class="calibre6">The forest of oaks along the Messina Road made for good cover should we needed it, God help us. Luca is a tough and unforgiving man, with his own rules, and I have not seen another man best him in anything physical. He vows he will not hide in the woods, like a scared farmer would do, or a woman with children, and to this he will not compromise. Luca has traveled this way before, with Camillo, his older brother, who is a wiser, and some say a tougher man, but I have not seen him fight, so I cannot say. Three or four years ago, the brothers worked together, in *<i class="calibre5">Masserti’s</i> lemon orchard; at almost the same breath, they decided picking lemons for an assole like Masserti was not in their plan. They took a walk for adventure, as they claimed to be bored with the quiet of the farms (adventure, to them, was wine and <i class="calibre5">puttanu</i> and fighting). They abandoned the ladders, left their tools and started for the great cities of Sicilia: Messina, Palermu, maybe Marsala, two hundred miles away. “A fool’s trip,” I said, when they ask me to come along, but I did what they wanted and told them it seemed like a good thing for them to do. Why go? I had work, I said, but it was a bold lie, and Luca knew it, but he understood. In less than two weeks they were back, beaten and bloodied, cursing and complaining about their life on the road and every village they saw, every man and women they met, and their children. They never spoke about the trip, or did they admit to some fault or bad judgment, but after a good bottle of wine, Luca admitted the truth. Drunk on stolen wine, as they staggered on this very road, their only worry an empty bottle, and suddenly and from behind, they were set on by four men on foot, who walked softly, like cats, and pounced like mountain lions. They struggled with the briganti, fighting hard until they saw an opening and headed for the woods, but they went too far and too fast and Luca near died when he slipped on slime that covered the rocks and fell into the sea, as if thrown there by the hand of God. Drowning in the freezing water, he struggled against the waves, while begging God, or his brother, or someone else, to save him. Camillo dove into the waves and kept Luca’s head above water, until they made it to a pile of rock about a hundred feet offshore. The briganti are businessmen first, and refused to go into the water, as what did they see, but two dirt farmers shivering on the rocks. Once they decided to plain kill Luca and Camillo, and each brigand emptied his revolver(nothing more than old belly guns), near hitting Luca twice and grazing Camillo’s right shoulder. After a while the briganti tired of the sport, cursed the two and swore they would rob and kill them another day. Camillo and Luca passed the night on the rocks, near drowning at high tide, but they managed to get back to shore, hiding in the trees until their strength was back, when they headed straight home and swore not to utter a word of their trip, so as not to disgrace themselves in the village. I am not a coward, as it might seem to some, or the hero all men want to be, but somewhere in the middle of the two. I do not understand heroism, or men who are heroes, but I understand why Luca refuses to hide in the woods.  </p>
<p id="page_229" class="calibre6"> The long walk to Messina, maybe ten or twelve hours to the docks after dark, did not set well with me. The docks are dangerous at night, the worst of all characters hang there; <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> and other thieves, and drunks, whoremongers, and plain troublemakers. I was there in the army, and I remember it well, but it is the only way to get the boat for Calabria. What choice did we have?  The ferry runs early in the morning, if it runs, but our news from the city is old and discouraging. The docks will be crowded with Siciliani trying to leave for anywhere, America, Argentina, even Brazil. Any place life is better than here. If we miss the ferry, we miss the train and we miss the boat and our tickets will be worthless paper, only good to wipe a dirty ass.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Messina is a long walk,” I say to my partners. “Are we ready for this?” </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Walk?” Santo stepped back and shook his head. “Antonino, you are <i class="calibre5">pazzo. </i>The briganti will be like fleas.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We have no choice,” I answered. “Are we birds?  Can we fly? No. Then we walk, God dammit. We walk.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Walk?” Luca scratched the back of his head. “Walk?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, walk. A hundred a day make this trip,” but I was guessing on the number, figuring a hundred sounded better than fifty, but not crazy like a thousand. “We walk and watch, like the army taught us to do.” He laughed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The army?  Fuck the army. Who needs more scars?  The army way is always the wrong way.”     </p>
<p id="page_230" class="calibre6">“Maybe you are right. We will do it our way. You are the front man, our scout. I will stay back, watching from behind.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca’s eyes burned through me, not like the <i class="calibre5">malocchiu</i>, the evil eye, but I made the sign of the cross to be safe, as I had no protection. My grandmother carried three pieces of fresh garlic in her apron pocket, whenever she left her home. The garlic made her safe, she believed, against small curses and she would ask God’s protection against the big one. Fresh garlic. A superstition, Patri Carmine says, and not approved by the Church. But the truth, she lived by her own rules and took no shit from friends or enemies. The <i class="calibre5">malocchiu</i> she used as her weapon and the garlic was her defense, and her God was the last resort. A great woman, who may be dead before we reach Messina, and I will miss her.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca clicks his heals, like the Tedeschi (Germans) do and salutes at the same time.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, Capitano,” he says. “I always figured with your bitching and complaining, you liked being a soldier.” He was relaxed, but serious. “But this is the last time I salute you. <i class="calibre5">Capisce</i>, pisano? Never push me. I do not like officers. I hate them all. Any officer, even a friend who is a pretend officer. And you…if you were a real officer, I would shoot you in the back. All Officers should be shot in the back. <i class="calibre5">Sul retro.” </i>He laughed. “<i class="calibre5">Io scherzo</i>. I am joking…you know it.” He patted at the pocket where he held his relic of a pistol. “Maybe I am not,” he said.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">I think, my God, joking, or not, I needed to escape, a place to run.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am joking,” he said again. “Joking, <i class="calibre5">mio amico</i>, that all. But you look so serious.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, of course. <i class="calibre5">I</i> know you are joking,” but Santo’s face was white.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">We are Sicilian dirt farmers, poor men, outcasts, but like the rich men and privileged men, we want a good life, and there will be no good life in Sicilia for a hundred years, or never. In a good world…no…in a better world, there would be no reason to leave. I realize it now, and it pains me in the gut, that I have been cheated. So, I will die in some foreign place where I cannot speak the language, where I am hated, but my life will be better. Who leaves his home when he has a good choice? No sane man. The family is sad that I am leaving, except my grandfather, who understands (and he is glad I am taking his vines to the other world).  Floating in my head are the thousand stories I have heard, bad stories, and if I think too much, I think I am doing wrong. Stay home, they say, things will be better, if not tomorrow, the day after. Your mama? Your papa?  They are old. Why do you leave them weak and fragile, to their own?  The men who say this, and there are many, maybe feel hope when I feel despair and maybe they see beauty when I see ugliness. The simple question: if it is good, why do so many leave?  The answer they give together, as if practiced in a group, if it is bad, why do so many stay? There are doubts and only a fool would not question the right or wrong of it.  Leaving my home and family, for a dream far away in a place where I have not been invited. Is this an act of desperation? Are we desperate men? Am I a desperate man? I believe so.  </p>
<p id="page_231" class="calibre6">‘Desperate man.’  I do not like the sound of it. <i class="calibre5">Briganti</i> are desperate men.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Andiamo? Are we ready for Messina?” Both Santo and Luca stared.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I mean walk. Are ready for the walk to Messina?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, walk. Andiamo,” Luca said it in his loud, intense voice I always found annoying.   When I come back, I will shove a handful of money in someone’s faces, and he will kiss my ass…ask me for work, and I will be as bad as any goddamn capu’s. Mark my words.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Where is the joy? He said he had joy, but I did not hear it in his voice.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo was happy, he said, but I saw no joy in his face.     </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Briganti</i> are desperate men. We are desperate men. Are we <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>? </p>
<p class="calibre6">We took the first step to Messina.     </p>
<p id="page_232" class="calibre6">The road under foot is old, thousands of years, built by Greeks, who were invaders, <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>, and not invited to Sicilia. Trespassers. They needed good roads to move their armies to make slaves of my ancestors. They were their own plague, these trespassers.  The goddamned Greeks are gone (and dying in their own country) and good riddance, I say, and now we have, not Greek plagues, but our own plagues; home grown and festering and bleeding, like wounds that will not heal, dripping puss until everything is infected. Crooked politicians, crooked priests and bishops, and crooked landowners, and the crooked soldiers and cops, who defend them.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca once the soldier, took to the front of the line as the lookout; he was built by God to smell trouble and for this he will lead us Messina, but every fifteen feet, he rubs his back pocket. The gun, the goddamned gun, and I knew what was in his mind, “let these bastards come.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I sometimes think of the pleasant stories I have heard, that are with me, floating in my head. Who knows what is true, or almost true? When these stories make it up the mountain, they are old and have changed, maybe a hundred times, and what is truth and what is the exaggeration of some <i class="calibre5">ubriaco</i> who sleeps with a bottle of grappa?  I think it was three months past, a steamer bringing <i class="calibre5">contadini</i> to America sunk, t with it five hundred men and women and children. Most drowned, but many some died on a raft, frozen, and when we heard it, we argued on the good or bad of it. Drowning or freezing to death. What is the better? These were souls from the mainland, near Calabria and thank God, none of the poor bastards were from Sicilia. Dead Calabrese? A bad thing, I believed, but better than dead Siciliani, and thankfully we have no  relatives in Calabria. The bad news came by the fishmonger, *Roberto Puzzi, who has a reputation as an honest man, when the truth has nothing to do with the fish he peddles (yesterday’s fish is fresh fish by his reckoning). True? <i class="calibre5">Chi lo sa?</i> (Who knows?) There was another story we hear, from mama’s brother, Andrea, of an immigrant boat stranded at sea five or six weeks, because the engines stopped because of poor repair, and the ship no longer carried sails, as sails are old fashioned. The poor bastards tried to survive by burning furniture to keep warm, but once the furniture was gone, there came violence. And we hear stories of brutality against Siciliani who have gone to America, not counting the story from <i class="calibre5">Fiorini</i> on the beach, who has a bad reputation for dishonesty. Who does not believe what they want to believe? Luca swears these are bullshit stories from the bosses who want to keep us here, working like dogs for nothing, playing one contadini against another, and smile while they watch as we rip each other to pieces for a day’s work. Me? I fear what I have not seen and touched and smelled, that is most everything.    </p>
<p id="page_233" class="calibre6">We spread out a hundred feet, front to back. Were we too careful, like women? After a short time, my back and shoulders ached from shifting the pack side to side across my back. Thank God, the weather is good, and we are enjoying it, the warm sun and the blue and cloudless sky. It is Fivraru (February), and a shift in the wind will change everything, not for the better. It never snows by the sea, but there is some snow in the high hills, always in Fivraru on Etna.  Sometimes in summer. Luca looks back at me at the end of the line.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino. What is going on back there?”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Niente</i>. Nothing. All quiet here.” Si, it was silly, like the game of soldiers men play as children. It was fun, then, because it was not real, when a mortal injury was a scraped knee, and everyone was a hero. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo was not a soldier, but today he guarded the middle, armed with the sign of the cross. “My mother says Novena’s to Sant’Agata, praying for our safety, that we come home the same good and honest men we are, but with money in our pockets. We went to Novena Sunday night.”  Luca laughed.  </p>
<p id="page_234" class="calibre6">“A Novena? A waste of life. Not Antonino. Look him, he would make a god dammed good priest, a fat, old priest. But novena’s, what foolishness, a waste of time.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca never trusted Santo. Me? I am not sure what Lucas thinks of me. He always says  somewhere, buried inside me, there is a priest trying to escape. I do not preach, or enjoy the preaching of priests, or do I believe most of what they say, or respect them because they are priests, except on Sunday and holidays. I have slowly fallen away, no longer a religious man, but a worrier. That is what I am, but no priest. Novena’s? Why not? Never take a chance.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo was the believer; his tightened when Luca talked heathen. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca kicked a small rock to the side of the road.  Zio Andrea says, “Live here, in Sicilia…die with your own. You will be better off and prosper. You know what you have. What is over there…a promise. Who are the people who make these promises? Over there Siciliani are treated like dogs.” Zio has not seen it, but he has heard what he knows from other men, men he says are trusted. “You are a worrier,” he says to me, “like your mother’s people, who all grow old before their time.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">There are things I hear and cannot forget and hope they are not true, or if they are true, they will not happen to me, or to anyone I know; mostly not to me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The Gentile family, they are new in the village, but they have some money and some land, and because of this fact they are important. <i class="calibre5">Raphaelo Gentile</i>, the oldest son, defied his father, went to America, and was disowned, though he was still called ‘son.’ The family was from Messina, all educated, and their children were taught reading and writing, except the two daughters(it is not important for women to read or write, they say, and I believe this to be true, but not as true as I once believed it). The family came here for cheap land, that’s all. Signuri <i class="calibre5">Pasquale Gentile</i>, himself over seventy, was taught to read and write by a priest from the mainland, and he taught his sons the same. The two youngest boys, <i class="calibre5">Carmine Gentile</i> and <i class="calibre5">Gennaro Gentile</i> would not disobey their father; they stayed in Sicilia to be near family. A few years later Carmine gave up his share of the family land and went to Messina to teach children of the poor. His father was angry, considering this a waste of his sons’ life, as the poor have no future, and die young from disease because of the way they live, in filth, and by drinking unclean water. His other son, Gennaro, became the village <i class="calibre5">anagrafe</i>(clerk); not a farmer and with no ties to any piece of land, but in the end, he owned much property(mostly stolen, I understand). The father was proud of Gennaro, because he stayed and did not abandon his family; proud that his son would be buried in the country of his birth, not wasting his life teaching those born with no reason to live. The father played briscola in the piazza on Sunday after Mass and repeated his declaration of pride in his son who stayed, to anyone who would listen. The runaway son, Raphaelo, did not ignore his family; he wrote often from America, long letters, complaining of hardships in the strange country, and poor conditions on the ship he took to America. “Not fit for pigs,” are the words I remember, and complaining on the “miserable” food, that many had to beg and steal from those who had it. The ship was foul smelling and filthy, like a stye. Halfway across the sea, rebellious Siciliani protested conditions to the captain, and when he refused to listen, the Siciliani attacked and threw food and furniture and ships property overboard. Raphaelo joked, “I prayed for the fish.” He never admitted being one of the rebellious Siciliani, and his father swore an oath he was not. To strike back at this riotous behavior, the captain, who was Tedesco (german), cut rations on what little food was provided, except in first and second class, who, as I learned later, paid double and were entitled to all the good food they could eat. Raphaelo was in third class, as he did not have the money for first or second class, and he would not ask his father, on principle, so he lived for weeks with no fresh air, no sunlight and was forced to beg food from good Catholic men and women. But again, his father swore on his mother’s head, that Raphaelo not rebel. Men who had made the trip before, some were prepared and brought food in their packs. Sleeping conditions, he told his friends, were far worse than in any crowded Sicilian hut. Six people were fit into a space for two; fist fights and other beatings were common, and the crew used clubs to threaten passengers, men and women, and the children were terrified. A man is not a man when his family is mistreated and he can do nothing, or he can do something, but does nothing. He complained that in America things were no better. He worked the worst jobs, cleaning streets, entrails in the packing plant and shit in the toilets. He worked for half of what the Americani were paid. One days he was punched bloody by a street rioter who complained “a wop took his job,” and Raphaelo offered it back to the protester, who punched him again. Raphaelo decided to stay, confessing to friends his new country was like a good whore; dirty, dishonest and violent, but there was something about her that brought him back for more.          </p>
<p id="page_236" class="calibre6"> Raphaelo’s father denied the letters, proclaiming his shame for his son because he was a com[plainer. who could not accept things as they are? ‘It is a sin to want something you do not have, or that God did not give you at birth.” Me? I am content fearing what I cannot see or touch and this makes me feel safe. Simple things I can handle with the best of men, working, drinking, playing cards, but anything else, is like walking into a pitch-black room where I have not been before.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I know this, I feel it, <i class="calibre5">nel mio cuore</i>, in my heart…there will be trouble.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Worry</i> is healthy,” Patri says. “And <i class="calibre5">fear </i>is a good thing. Without fear, without the worry, the consequences are not important. We would all sin, all the time.” Heaven and hell is the only reason things happen. Patri is a serious man, a fine man and a preacher, and mostly I respected him, as did my mother and father.       </p>
<p id="page_237" class="calibre6">Across the Straits, near hidden by the mist, are the mountains of Calabria, faint and faded, like an old picture on the wall. The high hills and mountains line the road, and a village tops each peak, like a great bird sitting in a nest. The villages are ancient, and the next village is older than the one before it; we live in the clouds as a defense against the <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> and other bad men. It takes a good man on foot, or leading a mule, a day, sometimes more, to reach some of these towns, by a narrow and winding path to the top. There are men in my village who have not been off the mountain in years, and two, at least, the crazy *<i class="calibre5">Cartolli</i> brothers, have never seen or smelled the sea, except from the overlook in the piazza. “Water is water,” they say. Me? I have been here before; like a vacation, a gift from the Italian Army, along with the promise of two years’ work. I am grateful they did not get me killed, or seriously wounded, even a minor injury.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">These good men who go with me to America, I have known them all my life. One is day, one is night. And me? I am somewhere in the afternoon. But I trust them with my life, to their faces, at least, behind their backs I wonder and cannot honestly say.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo, of the two men, is timid, but he has faith. He leaves his wife behind, Teresa, but they have no children. I say “wife,” and Santo swears they were married in a church, before God. Who were the witnesses to this marriage besides God and the priest? Who knows? Teresa is a fine woman and pure of heart, who will be faithful when he is gone, so he has said many times. But I know the fear men have, that when they return two, maybe three years later, and the door opens wide, that they are greeted by a young one who was not there when they left. Carmela? With her I have no such fear. It is not possible. Teresa was born in another town, she is not this village and a stranger to us, and no one remembers when her family came to the village, but they lived in a shack at the end of Via Capri, owned by <i class="calibre5">il Sindaco</i>, the mayor, <i class="calibre5">Don Luigi Farfella</i>, who was given the house by his grandfather, *<i class="calibre5">Enrico Formini</i>. Santo tells this story, that one day, in the hills, enjoying the sun and clean air with Teresa, for some reason he could not explain, and for no special reason, they were struck with the mood to marry. On the path they met a priest, from Roma, who was in the village to pray with his mother, who was near death. They confided in the priest their desire to marry, and soon; that very day would be good.     </p>
<p id="page_238" class="calibre6">The priest reprimanded both of them. “It is carnal, the flesh, that is all,” but agreed to marry them immediately to avoid sin, or further sin (did they already sin, he demanded to know, and they said “no,” not completely, but in any case, only once). The priest bowed his head, thanking God he had run across Santo and Teresa before they lost their souls to the carnal devil. The ceremony, and Santo swore there was a ceremony, was not attended by family, and it was done quickly in some mountain chapel, and for this Santo paid one lira to the priest, who thanked God he was there to save them, in their time of spiritual need. He gave his blessing before leaving, reminding them not to forsake the Church and her sacraments. This is the story Santo tells, and the details have never change, not that anyone believes a single word. So, and I believe this to be true(but what is it my business), they live in sin, plain and simple. The village women, especially the old ones, ignore Theresa, and a few even spit on the ground when she passes them in the Piazza, on her way to the fountain, but the younger women, and all the men, ignore what she is, a woman who likely lives in sin. To be honest, I have no interest in who dishonors who, and it would not shock me or outrage me, if I was presented with absolute proof they live in sin.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who claims not to be a sinner, is a sinner, because they lie and lying is a sin, and there are greater sins than sharing a bed, not blessed by Mother Church.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Patri Carmine said this, and I believe it to be true.    </p>
<p id="page_239" class="calibre6">My sisters, Agata and Maria, my mother, prayed for Teresa, but did not judge her harshly, until she told other women she had no interest in bearing children, as children seemed to be a great burden and interfered with a good life(I have found this only partially true). Maria, so shocked and offended by what she heard, repeated Teresa’s blasphemy to every woman in the village who did not otherwise hear it in the piazza. Not blessed with children is Gods will; not wanting children, or claiming they are a burden, is wicked and selfish, no more than what the devil would say. Teresa suffered more from my sister’s loose mouth, than the evil she did by sharing a bed with a man not her husband, if that is the case. Not that I judge her. Not at all.  Most of the time, I agree she has presented herself as a good wife. She was born a *<i class="calibre5">Rossi</i>, and her family is better off than most in the village, but they own very little land, and they do not hire out the work, or do they have servants. They have some money, but where did it come from?  <i class="calibre5">Chi lo sa?</i>  Santo has left her nothing but the room they live in, and if her father will not pay the rent, she will be kicked into the street.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What will she do?” I ask Santo. “She will do fine on her own,” but he admitted counting on the charity of her father, a  God-fearing man well known for his minor acts of charity.  I </p>
<p class="calibre6">I reached back and patted the pack I carried across my back. My grandfather’s vines. I hope they survive and more, that I survive to plant them by the sea, because I refuse to live anywhere in America, but by the sea, so I hear the waves and feel the mist. I will live in no other place.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">It is maybe three or four in the afternoon; the sun is behind the mountains, and I see no  chance we make it to Messina before dark. The road at night is dangerous, like the city. I glanced along the woods looking for places to hide, if need. Do I think like a coward? I think of it as being a careful man. Some might call me a coward. Luca will not speak of hiding, but anywhere   I look there are natural spots, behind trees, in thick brush, between rocks that fell from the mountains. I relaxed and enjoyed this pleasant feeling when I have a good place to hide.  </p>
<p id="page_240" class="calibre6">We have been in Messina before, except Santo, who has never been in a city or off the mountain, but maybe twice, and then only to Ali Marina to visit relatives. The thought of a city, squeezed by the crowds of strangers, is not to his liking. He wants to go home, but he denies it.  Where do we sleep when we reach the city, that will be in the dead of the night? The docks are bad, even in daylight, but at most times it is infested with rats and drunks and thugs, men running from the law, or the vendetta, people who wait for a chance to sneak onto a freighter, and they will stop at nothing. Sleeping on the docks has no appeal for me, as I prefer good pasture, or a space under the lemon trees, where the odor is pleasant and soothing.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The ferry to Villa San Giovanni leaves early in the morning, maybe the late afternoon, if they allow two a day to run. Rumor is the big landowners demand the government stop <i class="calibre5">contadini</i> from leaving, or the crops will die in the fields and on the trees, if we are not there to pick. If they stop us, we are done, and they will have us working for nothing, a plan they have wanted for a hundred years. One week’s pay for two weeks work. Take it or leave it. Not me. I will go off into the hills and live like a hermit and die. Tonight, we have no choice but to sleep with the thieves and the <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>, or in the woods with the goddamned beggars and the wolves, and the army deserters and evaders, looking for a boat off the island? Army deserters are desperate men, enough they will do most anything to stay free. No one, not even <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> from Palermu, are as dangerous as deserters. What do they have they to lose? Nothing. If they are luckless enough to be caught alive, and this is the army’s plan, sooner or later they may get a bullet in the eye(trying to escape)fired accidentally, of course, from an officer’s pistol. Men who soldier for a living, and this is their calling for whatever reason, love chasing deserters and do not abide them, or show them mercy, and more deserters end up dead, than alive.     </p>
<p id="page_241" class="calibre6">Backpacks and suitcases and bags and valises; these signs we carry scream out, “contadini…come and get us.” I met a man in the army (I forget his name) who was a killer by nature and did not need the training most of us needed to become killers.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Be fierce faced,” he said. “Your face must say it, that you take shit from no one. This is how you survive.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I am in trouble, if this is true.   </p>
