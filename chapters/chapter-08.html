    <!-- The Old Beggar on Peppino
On the road, the men meet a very old, poor, and filthy man riding a dying mule named Peppino, who shares his story.
-->
<div class="chapter-body">

<p class="calibre4">How far to Messina? Hours, yet. But miles. How many miles?  The great trees that seemed to reach heaven and hide the sea. But I knew it was there, the sea; I heard it and smelled it and felt the greasy salt grit on my face, but I could not see it. I have said this before, that I love the sea and will live next to the sea in America. For now, I worry about these great trees and the shelter they give the briganti, where they hide in wait. Briganti…all murdering bastards.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca yelled so the dead could hear.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino…up ahead…a rider…a rifle across his shoulder.”  Santo, hear the warning and saw the rider with his own eyes, edged toward the woods, until Luca raised his right hand and laughed.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Relax,” he said, and Santo stopped cold. “An old man on a mule. His rifle is a crooked stick…he is harmless.” Santo breathed deep and picked himself a broad oak and pissed on it. He sang some song I did not know, about a pleasant summer day in the hills. “I thought so,” he said when he finished. “The way he sits on the mule. An old man. Easy to see.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He was a very old man, seventy or eighty, leaning so far forward I thought he might fall off before he got to where we stood, as he looked to be in bad shape, and his mule, old, almost a swayback. The good years were miles behind both of them. The old man pulled and cursed, and the mule stopped a few feet short of where we stood, and we circled them in the middle of the road. The old man’s eyes were black and hollow, and he stared in a daze. Was he almost dead and frozen to the back of this old mule?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He snapped free of the daze and looked us over.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Bongiornu</i>,” he said, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his shirt. “Do you men know the name of this town? I have not been here before.” He smelled like fresh garbage, festering in the July sun. I was closest and took his full broadside when the wind changed. I turned and coughed, tasting the rush of bile running up my throat.     </p>
<p id="page_243" class="calibre6">“Where are you men going?” he asked. His head trembled; his hands shook so bad he finally hid them behind his back. “Where are you men going?” he wanted to know? Tell no one your business, my grandfather says; say nothing, not even to a foul smelling, harmless old man, and his dilapidated mule. How could I disrespect him for his age?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Messina,” I said, pointing north, offering nothing else. Was it his business?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He was <i class="calibre5">straccione, </i>wearing rags, not even clean rags, but filthy rags that cried for soap and water and a washboard, if they could survive a good scrubbing. He was uncomfortable, I see, fidgeting with the waist band of his <i class="calibre5">pantaloni</i>, that was tightly cinched with a thin rope. The pants were old and threadbare; his knees, all bone and no flesh, popped through the holes, and looked like ugly tumors attached to a frail body. He<i class="calibre5"> was </i>a beggar, no doubt; an old, old beggar who counted his time not in years or months, but days. Likewise, his mule, suffered with bad legs, all four, and a near hairless hide. “Swayback” means old and soft, with bones that bend and crumble; a body with little time left. The poor bastard struggled to breathe, even at rest, coughing like a human, that sent a chill down my back.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What’s the stick for, signuri?” Luca asked. </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man was hard of hearing, or near blind (or both), as he could not tell who asked the question. He always stared at Santo and nodded when Luca talked.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Stick? What stick?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The stick you carry across your shoulders, like a rifle.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh, the stick.” He laughed. “I keep it for the god damned dogs. I crack their skulls with it, if they get too close,” and he said it proudly, as if it made him a warrior. He groaned and leaned and pointed to the mule’s front legs. “These bastard dogs are wild. They nip his legs and he near threw me more than once along the way. So, I bash their heads good. If I get one square,” he points to his head, “you can hear their yelp and pain in Roma. It makes my day worthy.” He pointed up the road, to Messina. “I laid a few heads open about a mile back…did you hear it?”  I shake my head, no.    </p>
<p id="page_244" class="calibre6">“I am sorry, signuri. It has been quiet, like a funeral.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He asked, politely, could he sit with us, as he has not seen people for a day, maybe more. “Give me a hand down. Nothing my mother gave me works right anymore.” He whines the words; not manly, not even at his age. Luca gives him a hand, and the old man lets out a loud grunt when his feet hit the ground. Like a dwarf he was, maybe five feet tall; no doubt taller and broader in his younger days, but as I could tell, he weighed nowhere near a hundred pounds. Sickly and filthy, smelling worse than an old dog, were poor things to carry together. What does it take to find a stream, or a ditch with water?  His long silver hair was tangled and knotted and hung far over his collar. Even in the dimming light I see his green eyes were very green, and his nose far more Roman than Siclianu, too long and wide for his wasted face. Maybe in his youth, they fit well together, but no more.          </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazie,” he says, bowing slightly at the waist, like a man of means would do.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Beg your pardon for the stink, but I have been stuck to the back of this damned mule for most of two days maybe three. I am not certain.” He curls his lip. “Old men lose track of time. I am sure I smell more like a mule than a man, and for this I apologize.” He laughed, but it was true; the both of them smelled like rotting garbage in the July sun. I repeat myself, yes, but what other way can I tell the agony of being down wind of these two. “Rotting garbage in the July sun.”  I moved to his other side, as the wind changed, and now I was up wind of him.  </p>
<p id="page_245" class="calibre6">“We can find a clearing in the woods,” I said. “If you want to sit and rest.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Rest? No. Already wasting too much time. I need to walk off these aches and pains.” He locked his hands tightly, stretching his arms high over his head.  “Ah, that feels good,” he says, and I hear sounds, like breaking twigs, from over his body, mostly his joints. Never have I seen a man plain fall apart in front of me. He had no poke as I see no bulge in his pockets, or did he carry saddlebags and I knew it right off he was a beggar. Old man, or not, we had nothing to spare, no food, no water, no patience.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You live around here?” I asked. He looked at the woods, the sky and seemed confused. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, I do not believe so. I wish I did, but I think I live many miles from here.” He pulled a rag from his sleeve, like a woman, and dabbed at the sweat on his forehead and neck, while complaining the heat was bad for this time of year.  “I hope to make it home before one of us is dead. Once I would have prayed for this beast to drop dead first, but now what do I care.” He slapped it on the ass, but lightly; the mule moved side to side, but otherwise stayed in place. “I am from <i class="calibre5">Aci Catena</i>, somewhere around here. Have you men heard of it? A small town. Not many know it, since what it there to speak of. Empty, like the bottom of a hole. A few worked out farms, a little fishing on the coast, but thanks to God the mountains are covered with chestnut trees, except Etna. <i class="calibre5">Castagne</i>. I love <i class="calibre5">castange</i>(chestnuts).” He paused to stretch. “Have you seen the chestnut trees on the mountains? A grand and beautiful sight, the way they…”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca grew impatient by the old man’s rambling.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, Aci Catena. I know it. South, near Catania.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You have been there?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca points to the south. “Si, in the army. Garrisoned at Catania for a month. Maybe sixty or seventy miles from here. A four or five-day ride. Can you make it?”  </p>
<p id="page_246" class="calibre6">The old man scratched. “I made it this far,” he said, wiping the sweat from his forehead. “If I <i class="calibre5">do not</i> make it all the way, I pray a kind person will bury me off the side of the road, but in the shade…I cannot stand this god damnable heat.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I step closer to the mule, and it bucked, but the old man grabbed the reins and pulled hard and talked to it and it settled down. I have seen a nervous mule kick a man’s head to pieces.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why are you so far from home?” I ask. He thought. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Home? Why am I so far from home? Is that what you want to know?”  He thought. “Oh, si, I went to visit my brother…one last time, I figured.” He lowered his head and scuffed the road with the toe of his boot. “My brother and me. We are the last of our family. The others, all dead and buried. God rest their souls.” He bowed his head, as he made the sign of the cross. “Three sisters and two brothers, but now, everyone is gone except me, and I can say it, the last brother was my favorite, and I will miss him the most.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo follows the old man and makes the sign of the cross.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did he live far from here?” I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, si. On a farm, but not much of a farm. Its only value is that it lies on the slope of a hill near <i class="calibre5">Patti</i>, overlooking the sea. The soil is rocky, and the crops usually failed and my brother lived day to day, but he could never leave.  All the great beauty. I do not blame him.” He paused. “Did I say his farm overlooks the sea?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded. “Si, you did.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“‘My God it is beautiful here,’ I say to my brother, ‘you are a lucky man,’ but he said, ‘how lucky is a man who outlives his children and watches them all die.’ I understood what he said, in a way, though I have not been blessed with children. But I knew in my gut it was true.  </p>
<p id="page_247" class="calibre6">“Do you men have children?” he asked. “The great regret of my life is that there is no man to carry on my name…it dies with me.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. We have no children among us,” I said. “Only Santo is married.” Santo smiled and wanted to talk about his wife, *Agata Rossi, but the old man cut him short.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He points to his mule. “Only have boys,” he said. “Do not waste your time with girls. And do not wait too long to marry, or this is what you will bed down with at night.”  We laughed, but Luca, who was the best with women, seemed confused. He took a strong step toward the old man, who moved back, quick.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This trip you took. Are you saying you rode this ungodly beast, maybe two hundred miles, up and back to your brothers?”  The old man laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ungodly beast? Yes, it is an ungodly beast. But no. This poor bastard could not make the trip you describe.” He wiped his forehead, complaining about the heat, as he run the rag down the back of his neck. “I walked. Signuri. From my shack in Aci Catena, to Patti up north.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca stepped back and laughed. “I do not believe you. It’s a hundred miles. Maybe more…and you say you walked?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, at least a hundred. Who knows?” He stared at Luca, “and why is the distance important to you?” Luca shook his head.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No disrespect meant to you, signuri.  But I look at you, I do not see a man who could not walk ten miles and survive. No. I do not believe it.” The old man shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It happened. But I admit the walk near put me down. I was only a gasp, a breath away from meeting the grim reaper when I get to the bottom of the hill, and I could see my brother’s farmhouse. I was reborn and for the last quarter mile I was a young man again. Thank God I did not have to walk back but was blessed with a gift of this creature… I worry on its legs…the legs are bad.” Now I look better at the old mule, and I see its legs were swollen up and twisted, one joint twice the size of the other. </p>
<p id="page_248" class="calibre6">“Do you know these beasts?” he asked me. “It is all legs with these creatures, as you know if you worked the land. The legs say this old pile of bones has little time left. It was my brother’s mule, and his wife did not believe I would make it back home by foot, so she asked…no she insisted, I take it, as a gift. She warned it would not make it all the way to Aci Catena.” He grabbed at the frayed lapels of his coat, “but I knew it would, and it has done me right, at least until now, and I respect it because it is a creature from God.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You respect it?” Santo asked. “You feed it and wash it down each night?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. Nothing like that. This beast eats grass, and if it cannot not find grass, it does not eat. Who worries about me? And what fool washes down a mule? A waste of life, as I see it.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You respect it?” Luca asked. “You rode it into the ground…this animal is half dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man stroked the swayback, and the mule turned and looked at him.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I give it a name. It has never had a name before, just ‘mule.’ Now he answers to *Peppino. Peppino, the mule. And I never call him ‘it,’ although my brother had him gelded, but ‘he’ is what God meant him to be. ‘Peppino, you are doing fine. Peppino, only a few more miles.’ I will be sorry if Peppino dies with me on its back…yet it is the nature of things…but he will die with his own name.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And your brother?” I asked. “If I am not being too curious.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man stared at the ground and sighed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Dead. In his bed. A week, or so, ago. God rest his soul,” and he made the sign of the cross and Santo, listening close, made the sign, but Luca did not, and I did not.    </p>
<p id="page_249" class="calibre6">“God rest his soul,” said the old man, bowing his head. “I am certain God welcomed him through the gates of heaven. I hope to see him again someday.” It was an awkward time, in the middle of the road with a man and his mule, wondering what to say to a stranger about the death of his brother, who we have not met?  What kind of a man was he, his brother, and what good or bad did he do?  What do you say?  We said nothing, or did we offer our sympathies or say something that would make him feel better. Now I see, looking back on all of this, that we were wrong to ignore him.  Luca shook head.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You say you walked all the way just to see your brother? I do not believe it.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I did. I would have walked in the front door of hell to see him. He is the last of my mother’s children, except for me. As you can see, I am still here.” Santo took the old man’s arm and they faced each other.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How long did you walk? Did you see any <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Two, weeks, or longer, maybe. I was often lost, but what is time? Why worry about it?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A small animal, maybe a rat or a squirrel, runs across the road and the mule reared and near pulled out the old man’s arm.  I see he was suffering, as he rubbed his shoulder, but he never complained.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“As I was saying…si…I only walked in the daylight. At dusk, I stopped and looked for food, sleeping in the woods, or in a barn if I thought the owner would not shoot me between the eyes.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Were you afraid?” Santo asked. “Did you run into <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>?” he asked again.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Afraid? Afraid of what?  Do I look rich, or dangerous? What fool would think he could buy a chunk of rancid cheese with the coin I have in my pocket? It is a waste of good sweat to rob me.”   </p>
<p id="page_250" class="calibre6">Santo laughed. “You are right. Who would waste their time robbing you? Not me.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked close at his possessions. A worthless mule. No money, he claimed (but we all say it).  Not even his boots were worth the effort; they <i class="calibre5">were</i> leather, but cracked and rotting and the stitching was frayed, and the sole of his left boot flopped, foolishly, when he walked. In all, including his worthless mule, what he had showing, his boots and the cap, worth maybe a lira, not enough for one brigante to get drunk on cheap wine, or watered-down grappa.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “How did you eat?” Luca asked. “What did you eat?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Eat? Well. Let me see. When I left home, I put what little food I had in a pack, slung it over my shoulder and started walking. When the food was gone, well, I begged. Am I ashamed of it? I am not.” He pointed at each of us, me last, “and you men would have done the same.” He arched his back and stretched his arms, said he was feeling better and thanked us for being on the road, or he would not have stopped or rested, maybe dying on his mule and they would both wander until the mule died, or threw him off.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But you seem to be a proud man,” Luca said. “Begging? You are not ashamed to beg?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man shook his head, no.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am ashamed for my sins, not of being hungry. This is my first-time begging, and what are the rules? Am I supposed to be ashamed? Is it the law? You see, I figured when my food was gone, I would find a farmer, one not too rich, not too poor.” He wiggles his right hand, like a butterfly’s fluttering wings. “<i class="calibre5">Metà, a metà</i>…I wanted somewhere in the middle.” He coughed and the mule reared. “These poor farmers, I reasoned, have nothing to give, and the rich would want too much for stale bread and rancid cheese…stale bread and rancid cheese…like gold to these bastards.” The old man grabbed what he could of his thin waist.  “It worked for me, but not always.  I went hungry a few times, or I ate berries off the side of the road or stole fruit. Who misses a little fruit, a pear, an apple?  If I was starving hungry, I would look pitiful, making sure they saw the holes in my pants, or I would tell them Jesus’ wisdom, ‘What you do for the least of mine, you do for Me.’ These words worked for me, except when I stopped at the rectory in Villafranca, and the priest said he did not recall these words I claimed were said by Jesus, and he  insisted I work the day for a piece of stale bread and two sardines.”    </p>
<p id="page_251" class="calibre6">Luca laughed (he hated priests). “Then you did his work for him. The lazy sonofabitch.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man agreed that priests were mostly lazy men who lived off the poor and the weak. And not all are intelligent men, as he told the story of a priest near <i class="calibre5">Mongiove</i>, “a simpleton, but a better Christian than most, as he fed me first.” He bowed his head and kicked at a loose stone in the road. “I admit eating his bread and sardines, and when his back was turned, I ran off, telling myself I will pay for my sin on the way back, and work off the day as promised. Maybe giving him an extra days work to soothe my guilt. But on the way home…with this mule and all, I was ashamed to visit the priest, afraid he might want to feed us both, and he had little food to spare when I ran out on him. It would not be right.” Santo cleared his throat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Signuri? May I ask you a question?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have nothing to hide.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you see your brother, before he…?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Died? You may say it. Si, I did, and I thank you for your kindness. I saw him. He  passed a few days after I arrived. God rest his wonderful soul.” His eyes teared and we turned away so as not to see it and embarrass him, but he straightened himself and apologized for this show of ‘weakness.’ He said ‘weakness.’ I did not say ‘weakness.’ I saw no weakness.  </p>
<p id="page_252" class="calibre6">“Did he talk?” I asked, thinking of my grandmother, who was left behind. “You spoke with him?” He wiped at his eyes with the sleeve of his shirt, while asking for patience, if he seemed too much like a woman.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We spoke, yes, for what it was worth. He was weak, and near the end, just staring at me. I held his hand, at night, and he talked to me with lips, but no words.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">‘I love you, brother,’ I know he said, repeating it a hundred times over. His voice was gone, but there was strength in his look, and I could see it in his eyes, that he was not afraid to die, and thank God for that. What could be worse than the fear of death at that moment; could the pain be worse? When we were young, we argued, who was the better man?  As you plainly see, I am not much of a man, not brave like my brother, mostly a coward all my life. Near the very end he squeezed my hand, as hard as he could, for as long as he could; and I know him, I know what he was saying, that he was still the better man. And he was, even as he lay dying.” At this the old man rested and caught his breath and settled his emotions. “My brother was born at midnight, and he passed at midnight, and I held his hand until morning, when I buried him on the hill that looks at the sea.” He turned away again; the tears, I could see, were falling down his cheeks, like rain. “He was always the stronger man, the better man and I always looked to him for help and strength. This is the first time I have cried for my brother. Forgive me. I do not know you people, or do you know me.” I was glad he turned away, as it is my thought it is wrong for a man to weep in front of other men, no matter the reason.  I took his arm, but he pulled away. We left him in the road, weeping, and walked to a clearing in the woods and sat on the downed trunk of an old oak. In a few minutes’ time he joined us, saying he did not want to be alone, and for his own reason he picked a rock covered with moss, but shaped like a chair, and he settled on it. Seeing his grief, that he wept like a woman, made me uneasy. More, that I knew nothing about him, not even his name.     </p>
<p id="page_253" class="calibre6">“You are a lucky, in a way,” I said. “You had time with your brother, like the old days…when you were young.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> He smiled. “We were all born there, on papa’s farm. A long time ago.” He sighed. “Si, a long time ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then you have good memories, that are worth something, even for the long journey.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Good memories, yes. When we talked, he could only talk with his eyes and a slight nod of his head. I talked about the old grey neither of us could ride. Crazy wild, it was, and always bucked us both to the ground, on our asses, more than once.” He laughed, and looked back at his mule, still in the middle of the road. “This foul animal, my cognata(sister-in-law) swears, is a grandson of the very grey we talked about. Can this be possible? Papa’s grey was a majestic animal, that a king would ride. A wild one that showed up one day and lived for thirty more years.  I refuse to believe this old swayback comes from the grey…never. But it is a good story.” Luca laughed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man nodded, he agreed. “Si, but this pathetic creature has served me well, so far, anyway. Maybe tomorrow it will die with me on its back, or I will die with it under me.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, your family is all gone?” I ask.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, you are correct. Papa first, and mama a few years later. That was the worst time. I have been empty, like a hole, since that she died. I believe it was thirty, thirty-five years ago, or something like that. I left after she passed and have been back only a few times.” Luca touched the old man’s shoulder, softly, like a woman, and his show of warmth surprised me, as I had not seen this decent quality in him before, or since that day.            </p>
<p id="page_254" class="calibre6"> “Where do you go from here?” Santo asked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man scratched at the stubble on his face, as he did whenever we asked a question.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have nothing now, or no one, so I head home and wait to die. I imagine he might be there, waiting, when I walk through the door. What else can an old man expect?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I believe he spoke from his heart, for his dead family and about his own passing. In truth, whenever I see an old man, or an old woman, I think on my own mortality; how I will be when I am where they are now, old and waiting to die, and I will look old and talk old. A long way off, I think, but in truth on Monday, it is closer than it was on Sunday, and sometimes I think on it and shake.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo tapped his knee and cleared his throat to get the old man’s attention.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are going to America. Have you been to America, signuri?” The old man plain ignored him; Santo asked again, and this was agitating to the old man, and he gives Santo a dirty look. He raised himself slowly off the rock, grunting the pain, finally standing stiff and straight at attention, and he had the look of some Don, except he rode a rickety and diseased mule and dressed like a beggar and was frail and ready to die. I respected his looks, in a way, as a man with years and wisdom. This is how I was taught. .     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“May I present myself?” he said with pride, head high, his body stiff. “I am <i class="calibre5">Giovanni Nacello</i>, the son of <i class="calibre5">Giuseppe Nacello</i> and *<i class="calibre5">Angelina Campi</i>, both born in Sicilia, now deceased and residing with God Almighty. I am certain of it.” He wiped a thin hand across his ragged sleeve and shook my hand and Luca’s hand, saying, “grazie,” each time, for what reason I could not tell.  When he came to Santo’s extended hand, the old man stared through him with the most piercing look I have seen. When Santo asked again, “have you been to America?” Signuri Nacello turned away and covered his ears. </p>
<p id="page_255" class="calibre6">“I heard you the first time,” he said, with an angry voice, and a twisted face. “You are an annoying man,” and he wiped the back of his neck.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But I will answer, not that my business is your business.” He looked hard at Santo and shook his head. “I have not been to America, or any other place except Patti, where I was born and Aci Catena, where I will die.” He scratched at the stubble on his cheek and his eyes became brighten, and he looked straight on at Santo, “but I would have liked to visit the moon. But it is too late for my dreams such as this.” Santo nodded and smirked.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The moon? My God. What would you do on the moon?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“See the <i class="calibre5">man</i>,” he answered, pointing at the cloudless sky. “The old man up there. You have seen him, I am certain. The old man in the moon. I follow him each night he comes out…you know he is watching us. I would like to meet him and listen to his stories. Imagine what he has seen from his perch in the heavens.”       </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo laughed. “You are long in the tooth to be talking like a child.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man searched the heavens and sighed, disappointed, as there was no moon to be seen, and it might not be out tonight. “What he sees from up there,” he said again and sighed again. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Never mind up there,” Luca said, pointing to the ground. “Down here is all we care about. What have you seen down here, you and this foul mule?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man swore he “rode with Garibaldi,” saying it as proudly as other men who said it before him. Another one, my God. Was there ten million men in Garibaldi’s Army? I thought, from this date on, whenever I meet any Siciliani, I will start with “and when did you ride with Garibaldi,” and if they say “never” I will consider him an honest man. But for this man I had confused him, so it seemed. “You mean on the road? If you mean on the road, then, well, I saw nothing important, except those bastard dogs. Nothing I care about, that is. Nothing worth remembering, except…,” he paused and shook his head a few times. “Si. Now I remember. In Messina, it was hell all around, very exciting. Not what I thought it would be. Violence and commotion like I have not seen before.” He brushes the shit and the dirt from his shirt, that was marked with holes and threadbare cloth.   </p>
<p id="page_256" class="calibre6">“Men were rioting all over hell…exciting to see.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I ask the old man, shaking my fist near his face, “You saw rioting?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca’s ears perked, like a dog who sees birds to flush in the woods. There is a violent sound to the word “riot,” and this feel of death in the air when it’s said. Luca moved close to the old man and took him by the arm and shook him, but not too violent.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You saw rioting?” spraying spit onto the old man, who shielded himself with his thin arm, that trembled more than before.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Never turn away when I am talking to you,” Luca says. “Tell me what you saw and tell me now.” The old man tried ignoring Luca, even after his show of temper, that was real, and he slowly backed onto his rock, and leaned back, bracing his body against two wasted arms, complaining he feared his old bones would break into small pieces. His look was shy, like a cat, and there was a story he wanted to tell, but he would not be pushed or threatened, and would tell it in his own time. He talked on about his brother and the farm, and this agitated Luca, who paced, starring holes through the old man each time he passed him on the rock.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“After my brother passed, God rest his soul,” and he made the sign of the cross, “I stayed on and visited with his wife a few days...to help her clean up around the farm.” He wiped his forehead dry, sighed, and fanned himself with a trembling hand. “The goddamned heat bothers me,” he said, his voice weak, “more than when I was a young man.” It <i class="calibre5">was</i> hot, more humid hot than we expect for this time of year, but not hell hot, as papa calls the days you cannot breathe, like August. It was his age, I thought; he is at the end and cannot tolerate discomfort, as younger men do. “Before I left the farm, Assunta, my dead brother’s wife, gives me this wreck of a mule and I named him Peppino. It had no name, as I already said. ‘When the mule gives out,’ she pleaded, ‘turn it loose. Do not kill it, as it served your brother well,’ but she did give permission to kill it for meat, only if I was starving.  A mule is a stupid creation, good for pulling and carrying and shitting, and I have no special love for it.” </p>
<p id="page_257" class="calibre6">Luca paced, mumbling to himself. “Rioting,”  he kept saying. “Rioting.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you men have water?” the old man asks, but not for his mule; he would not expect us to give up water for a dumb animal, especially a mule. Maybe a regal dog, or something like that. The old man shakes his finger. “No, signuri, Peppino is on his own, and when he is thirsty enough, he will drink piss water from the ditch, if need be…. can you spare a little wine for me?”       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No wine,” I said, hard at him, but not rude. “But” and I thought twice before saying it, “we have a little water…very little to spare if you can help us out.” He nods, yes, he agreed. I give him a small taste from my flask. Only a short drink, I said, and he sipped more, slowly, as if enjoying fine Sicilian wine. At the end, he ran his tongue over and around his lips. I grabbed the flask as he went for another taste. “Just one more swig,” he asked, but he was thankful for what little I let him have, saying the others had not treated him near so well.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You were mistreated along the way?” I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Mistreated?” He thought; he starred away and shook his head. “Mistreated, you asked me? No. Not mistreated like you mean it, but ignored, that is far worse. Worse than a good crack on the skull. Who has time for an old man?” Luca disappeared into a thicket; to piss, I figured.  </p>
<p id="page_258" class="calibre4">He come back, all smiles, talking on the little pleasures in life. Pissing. I have not thought of it as a pleasure, but neither am I Luca.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca asked him again, now calmly, “You say you saw rioting in Messina?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I believe I might have said it.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tell us the story if you saw it.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You want to know what I saw?” He scratched at his face. “Si. Of course, I can oblige you, but I am a little dry…let’s see. Where was I?  Si, I remember now. I left my brothers farm early in the morning, to make my way home, and…”  Santo interrupted him.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Scusa, signuri. Why did you not stay at the farm? You are alone. It would have been the smart thing to do.” The old man was confused, confounded.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Stay at the farm? But she is my brother’s wife. It would have been wrong.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did she ask you to stay?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. ‘Stay and work,’ she said, but I refused. “You are my brother’s wife,” I said back.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But your brother is dead,” she said. “No matter, you are still his wife.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did your brother have children?” Santo asked.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes. Three. All dead. One within days of birth; another by bandits trying to steal seed, and the last from a tree and I will say no more of him. They are all buried on the hill to keep dry. My brother too. He wanted it that way. My sister-in-law has no family of her own. All dead from typhoid and other fevers.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo throws up his hands. “Both of you are alone. You should have stayed together.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man…no…I should use his Christian name, Giovanni, from now on; this look   he had, as if he just understood some truth that should have been clear to him his whole life. He was quiet for a time.  </p>
<p id="page_259" class="calibre6">“We are both alone. In that you men are correct, but she is my brother’s wife.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You should have shared the farm with her,” Luca said. “And what about the riots?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Giovanni, breathing heavy, his face turned red. “Mio Dio, what are you men saying? Are you  heathens? Is my sister-in-law a puttana?” Were we heathens? An honest question. I believe Luca is a heathen, but not Santo. Me? <i class="calibre5">Chi lo sa</i>? I am not sure of me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Giovanni fidgeted with his hands and twiddled his thumbs, like old men do.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But if you men are not interested in the story,” he paused and stretched his arms straight and groaned, “Then I will thank you for your kindness, and the water, and be on my way.”  He gets up, as he groans in pain that was unbearable, he said, and walked towards the road. Luca calmly blocked his way, like the gentleman he was not, using no force or coercion, at all.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I do not mean to interfere with your business, signuri, but I insist you finish the story about Messina, the riots you saw. Not you brother, not your mule, or your <i class="calibre5">cognata</i>.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Messina? Si. You want to hear about Messina?” He grumbled some, and complained the pain was worse every day, and one day if he falls, he will not be able to get up, and he will die where he lands, but he has always hoped to die in bed, like a civilized man, or in battle at  Garibaldi’s side. His brother died in bed, and his mother and his brothers and sisters. They all died in bed, like civilized people. Luca takes him by the arm.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“When you fall and cannot get up. Call for me. I will come and give you my hand.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Giovanni stared. “I expect you would rather kick me down than help me up.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You would not be the first man I kicked, but you would be the oldest.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I believe Luca meant this to be a joke, as I have seen him beat more than one man, but never an old man, or any man much older than himself. Fair fights, he always said; he lived for fair fights. I do not believe he ever beat an old man or any woman.  </p>
<p id="page_260" class="calibre6">“Riots, Giovanni. Tell us about the riots,” Luca says, in the calmest voice.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was surprised at his way, as was the old man, who nodded and cleared his throat.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">“When I left my brothers farm, I thought I would take the better way home, along the coast, through <i class="calibre5">Cefalù,</i> to <i class="calibre5">Messina</i>, then down this very road to Aci Catena and home, if it has not been ransacked, or broken up for firewood. But the goddamned <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> are merciless this year. I thought to get a gun, arming myself, but I have not fired a pistol since I marched with Garibaldi ’60, or maybe ’61.” He stared at me while he scratched the stubble on his check.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">God damn Garibaldi </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What was your plan to get home,” Santo asked.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Plan? Am I a god damn general? Garibaldi was a general. I went, that’s all. I went. A hundred miles, maybe. I had no idea. Seven, eight days with Peppino, if he lived through it. A few times, in the heat, I figured I would have to carry Peppino home.” We laughed, except Luca, who was too serious of a man, but what a sight it would have been. A man carrying the mule.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It was a two, three week walk to Patti…maybe less, I cannot recall, but I felt better going. The thought of seeing my brother kept me alive, though I did not know he was ailing and would soon die in front of me.” He shook his head. “But now, going back home? What was my hurry. I was next to go, no matter what. Who is left?  Me. Finally I am number one.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca was impatient, scratching itches and talking to himself and staring into the beyond. A certain sign that he was ready to blow, like Etna.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You babble too much, like an old woman. Mules and roads?  <i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo</i>… I do not give a shit about your mule. What about the riots? That is all I care about.” Giovanni did not like being called an old woman. Babble on? Men will fight, argue and curse, but never ‘babble on.’ It was wrong that Luca said it to the old man. Giovanni turns to Santo, who was sitting on a flat rock. “I thought <i class="calibre5">you</i> are <i class="calibre5">annoying, </i>and you are,” he said. He stared at Luca, “but you, signuri, you are <i class="calibre5">annoying</i> and <i class="calibre5">disrespectful. </i>I will no longer speak with you.” Loudly and powerfully, he said it, that he was in no mood to be pushed and driven by men he did not know. I believed he might have been a rugged man in his younger days, maybe even a soldier with Garibaldi.  </p>
<p id="page_261" class="calibre6">He excused himself, bowing like a gentleman, and wandered toward the weeds, saying he would soon return and finish his story and answer questions, if they were reasonable questions, and not personal questions about his life that he would keep private, as he said enough about his personal life, and now he felt like a fool. At the edge of the clearing, in plain view, he dropped his pants to the knees and pissed off into the weeds, cutting an arc a man half his age would be proud to display. He was still a vital man, it seemed. Another time I would have turned away, but I see his ass was covered in blood; some fresh, red blood and old, black blood. No one saw it, but me, as I was dead at his back when he pissed into the weeds.  He finished his business and sighed, pulling up his ragged trousers. “Ah…there is no putting off nature,” he said, cinching his belt; how good it felt, he said; how pleasant it felt to empty out so easy, and for a man his age. He declared himself a fortunate man; long living, the last of his line, pissing easy, with no pain, or very little pain, like other men he knew.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are bleeding, signuri,” I said. He turned to me and now he looked very old, <i class="calibre5">troppo vecchio</i>, and weak and I wondered how he was still with the living.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si…I know,” he said slowly, his head lowered. “I know. For two, three months, now. I have lost more than a quarter of my weight, I believe. There is not much left to lose. I will just disappear one day…not be here anymore.” He laughed, a weak laugh and turned away.  I grab his arm.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is there a doctor in your town?”  </p>
<p id="page_262" class="calibre6">‘Si, in Catania. A days walk up and back…I see him once. He did not know why I was bleeding and in pain when I shit, but there was something wrong. He tells me, “See your priest and ask him to pray with you.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you?” Santo asked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, signuri, I did not. But I thank you for your concern. I know what ails me, other than the curse of old age. The scourge that killed my father and his father, I believe, and my brother. I have a month, maybe two months left. It is a bad way to go, they say, and I admit I am afraid. I only tell you because I have no more shame. You asked why I did not stay with my sister-in-law. Why? Why would I stay with her knowing sooner or later I will be screaming and praying to die? No. I refuse. I will die alone.” He stared into my eyes, like the cold stare of death and I shuddered, and the sweat rolled down my arms. “If I had the nerve, maybe I would end this tomorrow. Or if I knew a charitable man who had nerve and the compassion to help a fellow man out of his suffering.” We knew what he meant. Everything went quiet when he said it; not even the wind through the trees made a sound.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He set back and relaxed on his moss-covered rock, that looked like a chair. </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “You all seem upset,” he said, as he put his hand on my shoulder.  “If you are, then I will say no more about it. But maybe one of you will help me when I need it.” Then he asks, plain and simple, straight out “will you kill me…will you do me this favor?” At this I near fell to the ground, though it was an honest request, as he was near dead, anyway. Luca and Santo stepped back together, and in the same breath they answer, “not me,” but Santo promising he would pray to Sant’Agata, that she make his final days bearable; that he not be angry with God, as it would prevent him from entering into the kingdom of heaven.    </p>
<p id="page_263" class="calibre6">He thanks Santo for the promise of prayer, “But prayers will do me no good. I thought, maybe, one of you would do this act of charity for me.” I step back a foot, or two.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Murder? This is the act of charity you want from one of us?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He points at Luca. “Your friend, can you tell me he does not have the black look of a killer,” and Luca clenched his two fists and moved toward the old man, who stepped back and stuttered.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I see the gun in his back pocket. For protection, no doubt, but this tells me you are willing to kill. Why else the pistol? You can do it now, right here on this spot.” He points to a place on the ground.”  Who will know or be the wiser?”  Luca grabbed him by the arm and pushed him away, the old man insisting he wanted to die at that very moment.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Look, old man, I am sorry for your infirmity. But all men die…my time will come, probably sooner than later, but whatever you think of me, I am no killer. No, signuri, I cannot help you.” The old man understood Luca’s feeling, but sill, what he asked was a noble and saintly act.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Shoot me between the eyes,” and he put his finger there and pressed hard.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Have you seen a man bleed to death from his assole. Have you?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">We look at each other, and agreed it was a horrible, brutal way to die, bleeding from your assole. “Si,” he said, his head down, tears in his eyes. “A man can linger for months, in agony, screaming, praying for death, a quick knife in the eye, while he wastes away to nothing, to the size of a small pile of shit. When he dies, if he has lived his life like I have lived my life…what is waiting for me up ahead, but an eternity in hell. Help me miss the agony here on earth, that I am sure to suffer. There is nothing any of us can do about hell.” He looks at Luca, pleading with his eyes, but Luca turned away.   </p>
<p id="page_264" class="calibre6">He put a finger between his eyes. “If you do not have the guts to do the Christian thing for me, then give your pistol to one of your friends. One shot and it is over, and I will suffer no more.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca cursed. “Sonofabitch. Your trip, the death of your brother has made you crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe so, but I see my future, unbearable pain and I have no guts for it. Do me this favor and I give you the mule and my shack in Aci Catena…for a few seconds of your time. I expect no decent burial...no Catholic burial. It is not important to me.” He scuffed the ground beneath his feet and pointed to a high stalk of weed and bush. “This is a good place,” he said, “Out of the sun. Leave me where you drop me, and let the vermin finish the job.” He waited patiently, hands folded at his waist, but there were no takers, not even for the mule and the shack in Aci Catena, but Santo offered the promise of prayer. After a short time, when I believe he expected one of us would turn, he accepted our refusal to do him this act of charity, as he called it. In the end he understood our fear of burning in hell for his murder.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So be it,” he said, seeming to accept his fate. “I hope I have not ruined your day, but as you see from the blood, I am desperate, so now I must find someone back home who will do this favor for me, because I do not have the guts to do it myself.” I felt sorry for him, alone, dying in the worst way, and I freely admit thinking about his offer and considered it for a time. Would killing him be charitable, the right thing to do, or plain murder? But if Luca would not do it?   The old man took deep breaths and cleared his throat. “As I was saying before I asked for this small favor…si, I rode into Messina on Peppino thinking I would beg a meal at some inn or bar, or on the street, as I was desperate. I went off and found the docks, and I enjoyed the sight of the sea, a sight I found to be a restful, like the warm feeling of wine drunk before you pass out. As I stood there thinking on things, this Carabinieri pulled me aside and complained about Peppino.  </p>
<p id="page_265" class="calibre6">“If this mangy animal shits on my dock, you will clean it with your own hands.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">‘Va' fa' un culo. </i>Go shoot a goddamned <i class="calibre5">brigante</i>,’ I wanted to say, but I had no energy  </p>
<p class="calibre6">to  argue, so I bring it in to the weeds and it did its job, and the cop moves on.”   </p>
<p class="calibre10">Giovanni sat on rock and complained the moss is wet, but I believe he was bleeding, and </p>
<p class="calibre4"> it was blood he felt.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What was I saying? Si, I was talking about Messina. I cinched Peppino to a tree and watched the sea, and all the iron boats in the harbor. They are a grand thing, better than wood boats, and I am told they will rot through, but rust after a hundred years. I am thankful I have lived long enough to see them, the iron boats. Have you men seen the iron boats?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca was always an impatient man. “Si, si, we have all seen the boats. But finish your god damn story. Explain these riots you say you saw.” Giovanni stood, as if ready to fight Luca; a comical sight, a man with the body of an ape, against a man whose ribs were easily counted through his shirt and jacket. They stand, face to face; Giovanni sticks his finger in Luca’s face.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are a rude young man,” he says. “Now I am glad you would not do this favor for me. You would enjoy it too much, so maybe I will leave and keep you wondering.” Luca did not apologize, if that is what was expected, but he did admit that sometimes he talked to much, and  the old man saw it as an apology, and went on with his story.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Let me see.” He scratched at his sunburned nose. “Si, you men asked about Messina. Now I recall. Hundreds were standing around doing nothing, waiting for the ferry to leave;  travelers, mostly, hauling children, bags, and suitcases. All headed to Napoli, I figured, then off to America or some such place. Who knows where? I am not interested in other men business, or what they do. ‘Be happy with what you have,’ my father said, and my brother said it. Good words to live by. Do you agree?” He complained his ragged clothes were ready to fall off his back. And the pants he wore, they pinched, he said, in the wrong place, and he gently moved himself to the other side, and smiled. “I was sitting on my <i class="calibre5">balle</i>(balls). What pain,” he said, but laughed about it. He licked his lips, which looked to be dry and parched and cracked, wiping them with a sleeve.  </p>
<p id="page_266" class="calibre6">“Do you have water?” he asked me. “Or better…a little wine?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No wine, Signuri,” I said, politely, thinking it would be bad for his condition, if it was my business.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We have no wine...remember. But I can spare a little water. Then no more. It is all we have for days.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, si, you have no wine, but water. I remember.” Before I could open the water flask, he asks again, “do you have wine?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No wine,” I said. “Water,” trying not to show my anger(he was dying). </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I would enjoy a little wine. Half a glass would do me fine.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No wine, signuri. Water.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I would enjoy a small glass of wine.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you finish this story, I will get you the wine. There is a bottle hidden in my bag.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">What was the matter with a small lie? In a blink he will forget asking, and I will never see him again and will not have to explain my lie. For a lie, it was a minor lie, near harmless.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazie,” he answered. “I will enjoy the wine…now let me finish…let’s see…oh, yes...there, uh, there…” Luca pushed and prodded him along.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hundreds were waiting for ferry…that’s what you said.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “<i class="calibre5">Si</i>.  You are correct. At least fifty. No more than a hundred.” He was confused.    </p>
<p id="page_267" class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si</i>, yes. They waited on the ferry to Calabria. Now I ask you? Who would go to Calabria? It is a Godforsaken place, I hear. Then I see men…troubles makers, I believed, touching swords with a guard, or a soldier, or a Carabinieri, but he did not have one of those great hats. Maybe he did. My eyes are not so good. Anyway, they argue over a place in line, but I could be wrong. Why argue about such a foolish thing? The guard had the better hand in this fight, and he threw a troublemaker off the gangplank, who was screaming and cursing, at first, then the fists came out and they rolled on the ground. One man punching hell out of the other, but I could not tell who was who. Was it my business? Did you find the wine, like you said?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not yet,” I answered, but refusing to look him in the eye. “Finish your story. Go ahead. The wine is here. I am certain of it,” and I poked around my bag, but feeling it was wrong and sinful to lie to a dying old man. Giovanni, I mean, but I always seem to call him ‘old man.’   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You’re a kind young man,” he patted my knee. “<i class="calibre5">Si</i>. Yes, now I remember. Some <i class="calibre5">piantagrane, </i>a troublemaker yelled ‘murderers…you are all goddamned murderers.’ Who accused who, I cannot say for certain? A soldier points his rifle straight at a man’s head; but the soldier was poorly trained, as the man took it from him, and they began trading punches. Then a shot, maybe two, or three, but with the echo off the iron ships, it sounded like total war. Or hundreds of shots, I cannot say for certain. But there were at least two, I believe. I see a man fall to the ground, not forward an inch or backward an inch, but like a sack of flour and he lay still and did not move or cry out. I have seen dead men before. He was dead. <i class="calibre5">Morte</i>. All dead men have the same look.” He pauses. “Did I say I fought with Garibaldi?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo made the sign of the cross. “Are you saying the cops killed a man? Are you sure he was dead? Why would they kill a man for getting on a boat?  You make no sense.” The old man shrugged. </p>
<p id="page_268" class="calibre6">“I do not know. But I am certain he was lifeless. Dead is lifeless, no? Dead as the truth. I have seen dead before…in ’61…with Garibaldi. Many dead men. But I see you are not interested in this great man, so I will not mention him again.” He points at his own body. “But yes, there was blood and this poor bastard had two, three holes in him, or one big hole. I could not tell. Women were screaming and grabbing for their children. The noise of a cops’ whistles…I hear it in my head.  Chaos. It was Chaos. Like the end of the world as Patri Amondinni has said it would be. Si, I believe he said it.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca tosses a pebble at Giovanni, and it hit him in the leg and startled him.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then there <i class="calibre5">was</i> a riot on the dock…you said it.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A riot?  Who said ‘riot?’” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You said ‘riot.’ You said it.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I do not believe I used the word ‘riot,’ but yes, it was a riot now that I think back on it.  When the rifle fired, and before the man hit the ground, I can say all hell broke loose. Men and women, children, running everywhere. A few fell into the water or were pushed. A young boy cried for help and two brave men dove off the dock and saved him and his mother was thankful for it. I cannot report all the confusion if that is what you want. I admit missing some of the facts, and yes, before you ask me, I feared for my life, if that is what you wanted me to say….does it make you feel better?” He nods, slowly. “I was afraid? Why, I wonder. My life has very little time left, it would have all been so easy. But I did not want to die, at that moment, at that place…I cannot say why.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I could see Luca’s heart pounding hard, and the vein in his neck was thick and it throbbed; one, two, three beats, and I wondered, do these veins ever explode, or leak? </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I say they had no good reason for killing the poor bastard. None. I am no coward, mind you, but I found an old shed sitting out of range. The fight was none of my business. I have not fought another man since ’61. Garibaldi. Did I tell you I was with Garibaldi in ’61?”    </p>
<p id="page_269" class="calibre6">This old man, Giovanni, I believed him to be crazy; too many years at his back, behind him and no years ahead. How does this ruin a man? I believed with the death of his brother, the grief he felt, his mind is gone. Or did he imagine all this shit too make himself feel vigorous, though he confessed to hiding, like some woman with a child, or two children.  Maybe the running and hiding shows he is still a man of vigor, or a conniving man, believing it might earn him some prize. Santo paced in place, ready to quit and go home. I know him. Luca is chewing on the bit, wanting to be close to the battle, for the smell of gunpowder and the sight of blood. I am critical, but it has happened before, and I am sorry to say this, but I cannot always trust Luca, and sometimes Santo. I felt alone.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you want to hear more?” Giovanni asked me. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, yes, more. Whatever you can tell us.”  He starts slowly.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I watched the battle through cracks in the wall; big cracks, big enough to put my hands through, and all the while my foot jammed against the door to keep them out should they see me and want to kill me. No one did. More soldiers came with the Carabinieri. They battled with the men who stayed, who fought mostly with their fists, but some cavone fired off more shots and they all scattered like scared geese. The dock was scattered with lifeless bodies; dead men, two. Maybe three.” He stopped and thought and scratched the stubble on his chin. “Maybe four,” and at this number, Luca grabbed his arm and twisted it and Giovanni screamed and I could see the tears in his eyes. Luca pulled him close.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Four? Now you say four dead men. Four dead men is a war…a damn good war.” Giovanni scratched. “War?” He thought. “Si, it was war. You make a good point, sigfnuri. Forgive me, but I have been in a bad way, on this filthy mule all day, or maybe it has been two days?” He bowed his head. “Let me see…there <i class="calibre5">were</i> men on the ground, but who could tell if they were dead, or playing dead, or just wounded. If they were wounded, were they wounded mortally, or hardly at all?” He brushed sweat from his forehead, while staring at Luca, who stared back, and I believe they were aiming to stare each other down. Such foolishness.   </p>
<p id="page_270" class="calibre6">“I saw five men, maybe six, pulling one of the fallen off the dock. I am ashamed to say it was almost amusing to see his head bounce on every plank as they dragged him away. I say it was almost amusing, if not for the women crying , holding their children for dear life, as you would expect. Weeping women means calamity and upheaval. The dock emptied in a few minutes, except for a man leaning against a bench, moaning and holding his head.  I did not know why, or did I care. A hundred bags were scattered around the dock, and I admit thinking of opening a few when all was quiet, but soldiers culled the bags and suitcases, piling the best into a wagon, pushing the junk and the leftovers into the sea. I pity the poor bastards who came back looking for their clothes…that is all…it was over.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca hung over the old man, who stared into the woods.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Look at me,” Luca ordered him, and he looked at Luca.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is there a piece of truth in what you say, old man? I have to know if this is true or bullshit.” Giovanni shrugs his shoulders, a sign that says nothing and means nothing. A shrug. What is it? What does it mean?  Luca leaned in close to Giovanni’s face, only a hand away.  “<i class="calibre5">Was</i> there a riot on the docks?” he demanded from Giovanni, who did not answer right off. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you see it, or dream it? A simple question. Have you been lying to us?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">No answer.  </p>
<p id="page_271" class="calibre6">“If you have been lying to us, then I will kill you now, like you wanted me to do before…kill you dead.”  I give the old man credit since he stood up to Luca, facing him like a man, and his only sign of fear (or old age) was trembling hands, that he stuffed into his pockets. I stepped between the two and worked to settle Luca down. I did not believe, for certain, he would beat Giovanni, who was, I admit, a pathetic figure of a man; he could barely speak and make sense, except to complain on the heat and beg for wine.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Giovanni took my arm. “Did you find the wine, like you said?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“There is no wine, paesano,” I said, and he dropped his eyes and stared at the ground.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I would enjoy a little wine. Will you find me a small glass of wine…<i class="calibre5">un poco</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I believed, with Luca, this old bastard imagined it all, but the blood on his ass was real, some red blood and some black blood. Maybe he was crazy from the heat and the long trip, that would kill a man half his age, and the grief from his brother’s death. In truth, this is what I hoped, that he was crazy (God forgive me) and imagined everything. If there was truth in what he said, in a few short hours we might be in the jaws of the lion.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Giovanni cleared his throat. “Do you boys have wine for an old man?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You ask the same question,” I said to him. “There is no wine.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No wine?  You say there is no wine?  You men go to America, and you bring no wine Three Sicilian men. I would not have believed it if I did not see it.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca kicked a rock, hard and I could see pain in his face. But it calmed him down.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“There is no god dammed wine,” he said to Giovanni, “And take your mule and leave before I do what you asked me to do.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He was and old man, but no fool, not an old fool, that my father says is the worst kind of fool. He took his mule by the reins. “There is no more I can say to you men. I will move on now that the wine is gone.” I walked to where he stood, and he stared at me and felt for my arm.    </p>
<p id="page_272" class="calibre6">“Is it true you have no wine?” he asks.        </p>
<p class="calibre6"> I gave him a last drink from my water flask; he thanked me, said how sweet it tasted, but he would rather have good wine the next time we meet. Santo gives him a small piece of bread and a quarter slice of cheese, that he ate in three bites, and he took another swig of water when my back was turned.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazie, for sharing with an old man,” he said. “I wanted a little food, but I am too proud to ask.” Santo walked to the middle of the road, and for no reason, other than his age, we felt a duty to see him off and wish him well. Luca stayed in the clearing, on his rock, staring off into the woods, a strange, frightening look on his face. Who knew where he was?  I knew.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What is wrong with your friend,” Giovanni asked. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He is somewhere else.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He is here. I see him sitting on a rock. I am not blind.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was thinking on the time Luca brought three, maybe four bottles of wine to the Piazza, on a hell hot night. Pay from his uncle Pietro, for work he did on a roof battered to pieces in a bad storm, that suddenly come off the mountain. We drank until the wine was gone. Luca could barely stand. I was not as bad; too wise to match him drink for drink, but when he drinks, he babbles, but I told him babbling is not what a man should do. He complained about his life, that was empty, with no good future.  He begins telling me his secret thoughts and other things he   imagined, and I near shit myself at what I heard. Wild talk, like I never heard before. That night I learned Luca dreamed of being a hero. If he hears a story with a hero, or a story that needs a hero, he is the hero. He listened to the old man, Giovanni, and put himself on the docks, with the soldiers and Carabinieri, who are threatening the <i class="calibre5">contadini </i>and mistreating women. The poor Siciliani need a hero. “It is me they need. I was born to be a hero,” and a rifle barrel is shoved in his face, and he sees red. He is ordered, “get on the ground,” but he refuses and draws his pistol and fires; the tormentor, whoever, falls dead. There are screams and pleas from passengers waiting for the ferry, who are frightened and run in every direction. He is standing over the body of a soldier, or some other official man. He is ordered to give up his pistol; he refuses, of course, as what hero will ever surrender his weapon. Angered at this disrespect, the soldier’s level their rifles and prepare to charge; Luca fires the last few rounds in his pistol. Fire is returned. It is the end of Luca’s tortured life, but he dies, gladly, as the people will remember he died a hero. Maybe he is shot by a coward of a sharpshooter, from hundreds of feet away; a man with no guts or he would have faced Luca like a man.  Not a fair fight, and no way for a hero to die. A crowd gathers around his body; well-wishers, and each, in turn, bids him luck in the afterlife, as certainly, there is an afterlife for heroes, if for no one else. Luca forces these last words from his mouth, “Tell my father I fought to the end, and died a hero…I am a hero…I must be a hero, or all this is for nothing.” The women weep, and the men turn away and hide their faces, as they weep, too. This is the dream he lives by. He said it that night in the piazza. But now we are here, on the road to Messina, and he is staring into the woods. There is no call for a hero, but I will wake him anyway, as it is time to move on.  </p>
<p id="page_273" class="calibre6">I took his arm. “Amico. Luca, are you with us? Wake up, friend. Where have you been?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I surprised him. “What?” he said, startled, and he pulled away. “Why are you holding my arm…what did I do?” He was confused and groggy, as if waking from a long sleep, or drunk on grappa.    </p>
<p id="page_274" class="calibre6">“Those bastards,” he said, rubbing his pocket, feeling for the pistol and finding it and smiling. “God help them if they try it with me.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is he alright?” the old man asked. “He looks crazy. Does he need a doctor?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Luca is dreaming,” I said. “In his man’s body, there is a child’s imagination. I point to my head. When he hears action, a bell rings in his head. “In here he was born to be a hero, that’s all.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Giovanni stared holes through both of us. “You are strange men. And your other friend is strange. Also, he is an annoying man.” He meant Santo. </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man coughed and doubled over, til he near threw up. He recovered and apologized, then out of thin air he complained he was tired of us and would move on, asking for one last favor, a leg up on his mule. I helped him but holding my breath. As soon as he settled on his mule, Peppino, he kicked and started North, up the Messina Road, but after a few hundred feet he caught his error, turned around and headed South. He left with no ceremony, or goodbye, or did he thank us for the bread and cheese and the wine (what did he know?) I say good riddance, as I figure he was nothing; no hinderance, or other pain in the ass, but a small inconvenience. I remember *<i class="calibre5">Signuri Nacello</i> as an odd little man, who I would forget before he was out of sight. But the truth is, I never forgot the sonofabitch and thought about him many times, always wondering if he made it home, and how long did he live and did he die painfully.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca, and this I could not believe, gave a finger to the old man as he rode away.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The old fool was not worth listening to,” he said. “He barely remembers yesterday. I pay no attention to him or his silly stories. Old man or not, I should have kicked is ass to Aci Catena.” </p>
<p id="page_275" class="calibre6">“But he raised his hand to God,” Santo said. “It is the same as talking to God, Himself, to his face. I am certain he did not lie. Some of what he said must be true.”   </p>
