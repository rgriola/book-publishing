        <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">Shelter from the Briganti</h3>

        <p>How far to <em>Messina</em>? Hours, yet. But miles. How many miles? The great trees that seemed to reach heaven and hide the sea. But I knew it was there, the sea; I heard it and smelled it and felt the greasy salt grit on my face, but I could not see it. I have said this before, that I love the sea and will live next to the sea in America. For now, I worry about these great trees and the shelter they give the <em>briganti</em>, where they hide in wait. <em>Briganti</em>…all murdering bastards.</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> yelled so the dead could hear.</p>
        <p>“<em>Antonino</em>…up ahead…a rider…a rifle across his shoulder.” <em>Santo</em>, hear the warning and saw the rider with his own eyes, edged toward the woods, until <em>Luca</em> raised his right hand and laughed.</p>
        <p>“Relax,” he said, and <em>Santo</em> stopped cold. “An old man on a mule. His rifle is a crooked stick…he is harmless.” <em>Santo</em> breathed deep and picked himself a broad oak and pissed on it. He sang some song I did not know, about a pleasant summer day in the hills. “I thought so,” he said when he finished. “The way he sits on the mule. An old man. Easy to see.”</p>
        <p>He was a very old man, seventy or eighty, leaning so far forward I thought he might fall off before he got to where we stood, as he looked to be in bad shape, and his mule, old, almost a swayback. The good years were miles behind both of them. The old man pulled and cursed, and the mule stopped a few feet short of where we stood, and we circled them in the middle of the road. The old man’s eyes were black and hollow, and he stared in a daze. Was he almost dead and frozen to the back of this old mule?</p>

        <!-- Section 2: The Meeting and the Stick -->
        <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Straccione and His Warrior Stick</h3>

        <p>He snapped free of the daze and looked us over.</p>
        <p>“<em>Bongiornu</em>,” he said, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his shirt. “Do you men know the name of this town? I have not been here before.” He smelled like fresh garbage, festering in the July sun. I was closest and took his full broadside when the wind changed. I turned and coughed, tasting the rush of bile running up my throat.</p>
        <p>“Where are you men going?” he asked. His head trembled; his hands shook so bad he finally hid them behind his back. “Where are you men going?” he wanted to know? Tell no one your business, my grandfather says; say nothing, not even to a foul smelling, harmless old man, and his dilapidated mule. How could I disrespect him for his age?</p>
        <p>“<em>Messina</em>,” I said, pointing north, offering nothing else. Was it his business?</p>
        <p>He was <em>straccione</em>, wearing rags, not even clean rags, but filthy rags that cried for soap and water and a washboard, if they could survive a good scrubbing. He was uncomfortable, I see, fidgeting with the waist band of his <em>pantaloni</em>, that was tightly cinched with a thin rope. The pants were old and threadbare; his knees, all bone and no flesh, popped through the holes, and looked like ugly tumors attached to a frail body. He was a beggar, no doubt; an old, old beggar who counted his time not in years or months, but days. Likewise, his mule, suffered with bad legs, all four, and a near hairless hide. “Swayback” means old and soft, with bones that bend and crumble; a body with little time left. The poor bastard struggled to breathe, even at rest, coughing like a human, that sent a chill down my back.</p>
        <p>“What’s the stick for, <em>signuri</em>?” <em>Luca</em> asked.</p>
        <p>The old man was hard of hearing, or near blind (or both), as he could not tell who asked the question. He always stared at <em>Santo</em> and nodded when <em>Luca</em> talked.</p>
        <p>“Stick? What stick?”</p>
        <p>“The stick you carry across your shoulders, like a rifle.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, the stick.” He laughed. “I keep it for the god damned dogs. I crack their skulls with it, if they get too close,” and he said it proudly, as if it made him a warrior. He groaned and leaned and pointed to the mule’s front legs. “These bastard dogs are wild. They nip his legs and he near threw me more than once along the way. So, I bash their heads good. If I get one square,” he points to his head, “you can hear their yelp and pain in <em>Roma</em>. It makes my day worthy.” He pointed up the road, to <em>Messina</em>. “I laid a few heads open about a mile back…did you hear it?” I shake my head, no.</p>
        <p>“I am sorry, <em>signuri</em>. It has been quiet, like a funeral.”</p>

        <!-- Section 3: The Beggar's Apology and Origin -->
        <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Smell of Rotting Garbage</h3>

        <p>He asked, politely, could he sit with us, as he has not seen people for a day, maybe more. “Give me a hand down. Nothing my mother gave me works right anymore.” He whines the words; not manly, not even at his age. <em>Luca</em> gives him a hand, and the old man lets out a loud grunt when his feet hit the ground. Like a dwarf he was, maybe five feet tall; no doubt taller and broader in his younger days, but as I could tell, he weighed nowhere near a hundred pounds.</p>
        <p>Sickly and filthy, smelling worse than an old dog, were poor things to carry together. What does it take to find a stream, or a ditch with water? His long silver hair was tangled and knotted and hung far over his collar. Even in the dimming light I see his green eyes were very green, and his nose far more Roman than <em>Sicilanu</em>, too long and wide for his wasted face. Maybe in his youth, they fit well together, but no more.</p>
        <p>“<em>Grazie</em>,” he says, bowing slightly at the waist, like a man of means would do.</p>
        <p>“Beg your pardon for the stink, but I have been stuck to the back of this damned mule for most of two days maybe three. I am not certain.” He curls his lip. “Old men lose track of time. I am sure I smell more like a mule than a man, and for this I apologize.” He laughed, but it was true; the both of them smelled like rotting garbage in the July sun. I repeat myself, yes, but what other way can I tell the agony of being down wind of these two. “Rotting garbage in the July sun.” I moved to his other side, as the wind changed, and now I was up wind of him.</p>
        <p>“We can find a clearing in the woods,” I said. “If you want to sit and rest.”</p>
        <p>“Rest? No. Already wasting too much time. I need to walk off these aches and pains.” He locked his hands tightly, stretching his arms high over his head. “Ah, that feels good,” he says, and I hear sounds, like breaking twigs, from over his body, mostly his joints. Never have I seen a man plain fall apart in front of me. He had no poke as I see no bulge in his pockets, or did he carry saddlebags and I knew it right off he was a beggar. Old man, or not, we had nothing to spare, no food, no water, no patience.</p>
        <p>“You live around here?” I asked. He looked at the woods, the sky and seemed confused. “No, I do not believe so. I wish I did, but I think I live many miles from here.” He pulled a rag from his sleeve, like a woman, and dabbed at the sweat on his forehead and neck, while complaining the heat was bad for this time of year. “I hope to make it home before one of us is dead. Once I would have prayed for this beast to drop dead first, but now what do I care.” He slapped it on the ass, but lightly; the mule moved side to side, but otherwise stayed in place. “I am from <em>Aci Catena</em>, somewhere around here. Have you men heard of it? A small town. Not many know it, since what it there to speak of. Empty, like the bottom of a hole. A few worked out farms, a little fishing on the coast, but thanks to God the mountains are covered with chestnut trees, except <em>Etna</em>. <em>Castagne</em>. I love <em>castange</em> (chestnuts).” He paused to stretch. “Have you seen the chestnut trees on the mountains? A grand and beautiful sight, the way they…”</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> grew impatient by the old man’s rambling. “<em>Si</em>, <em>Aci Catena</em>. I know it. South, near <em>Catania</em>.” “You have been there?”</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> points to the south. “<em>Si</em>, in the army. Garrisoned at <em>Catania</em> for a month. Maybe sixty or seventy miles from here. A four or five-day ride. Can you make it?”</p>

        <!-- Section 4: The Brother's Farm and the Truth of the Journey -->
        <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Last of the Family</h3>

        <p>The old man scratched. “I made it this far,” he said, wiping the sweat from his forehead. “If I do not make it all the way, I pray a kind person will bury me off the side of the road, but in the shade…I cannot stand this god damnable heat.”</p>
        <p>I step closer to the mule, and it bucked, but the old man grabbed the reins and pulled hard and talked to it and it settled down. I have seen a nervous mule kick a man’s head to pieces.</p>
        <p>“Why are you so far from home?” I ask. He thought.</p>
        <p>“Home? Why am I so far from home? Is that what you want to know?” He thought. “Oh, <em>si</em>, I went to visit my brother…one last time, I figured.” He lowered his head and scuffed the road with the toe of his boot. “My brother and me. We are the last of our family. The others, all dead and buried. God rest their souls.” He bowed his head, as he made the sign of the cross. “Three sisters and two brothers, but now, everyone is gone except me, and I can say it, the last brother was my favorite, and I will miss him the most.”</p>
        <p><em>Santo</em> follows the old man and makes the sign of the cross. “Did he live far from here?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“<em>Si</em>, <em>si</em>. On a farm, but not much of a farm. Its only value is that it lies on the slope of a hill near <em>Patti</em>, overlooking the sea. The soil is rocky, and the crops usually failed and my brother lived day to day, but he could never leave. All the great beauty. I do not blame him.” He paused. “Did I say his farm overlooks the sea?”</p>
        <p>I nodded. “<em>Si</em>, you did.”</p>
        <p>“‘My God it is beautiful here,’ I say to my brother, ‘you are a lucky man,’ but he said, ‘how lucky is a man who outlives his children and watches them all die.’ I understood what he said, in a way, though I have not been blessed with children. But I knew in my gut it was true.</p>
        <p>“Do you men have children?” he asked. “The great regret of my life is that there is no man to carry on my name…it dies with me.”</p>
        <p>“No. We have no children among us,” I said. “Only <em>Santo</em> is married.” <em>Santo</em> smiled and wanted to talk about his wife, <em>Agata Rossi</em>, but the old man cut him short.</p>
        <p>He points to his mule. “Only have boys,” he said. “Do not waste your time with girls. And do not wait too long to marry, or this is what you will bed down with at night.” We laughed, but <em>Luca</em>, who was the best with women, seemed confused. He took a strong step toward the old man, who moved back, quick.</p>
        <p>“This trip you took. Are you saying you rode this ungodly beast, maybe two hundred miles, up and back to your brothers?” The old man laughed.</p>
        <p>“Ungodly beast? Yes, it is an ungodly beast. But no. This poor bastard could not make the trip you describe.” He wiped his forehead, complaining about the heat, as he run the rag down the back of his neck. “I walked. <em>Signuri</em>. From my shack in <em>Aci Catena</em>, to <em>Patti</em> up north.”</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> stepped back and laughed. “I do not believe you. It’s a hundred miles. Maybe more…and you say you walked?”</p>
        <p>“<em>Si</em>, at least a hundred. Who knows?” He stared at <em>Luca</em>, “and why is the distance important to you?” <em>Luca</em> shook his head.</p>
        <p>“No disrespect meant to you, <em>signuri</em>. But I look at you, I do not see a man who could not walk ten miles and survive. No. I do not believe it.” The old man shook his head.</p>
        <p>“It happened. But I admit the walk near put me down. I was only a gasp, a breath away from meeting the grim reaper when I get to the bottom of the hill, and I could see my brother’s farmhouse. I was reborn and for the last quarter mile I was a young man again. Thank God I did not have to walk back but was blessed with a gift of this creature… I worry on its legs…the legs are bad.” Now I look better at the old mule, and I see its legs were swollen up and twisted, one joint twice the size of the other.</p>
        <p>“Do you know these beasts?” he asked.</p>
