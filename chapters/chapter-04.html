  <!--The Dead Man's Warning

Fleeing their village, the men meet a man believed dead who warns them of the violence and hatred against Italians in America.
-->

<p class="calibre4">The wind blew in small circles, stirring up dead leaves, and other small weeds that lay on the ground. We turned and walked backwards for a while to keep the dirt out of our eyes. Santo pulled his cap down to protect from the wind while he faced the heart of the village and cried.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Arrivaderci a tutti</i>,” he said, quietly, trying to hide his emotion, but we saw it all, and he was embarrassed. Down Via Calibrini, in front of past the bar, “La Ragazella,” Luca stopped and tipped his cap, saying this, with no shame, he would miss the bar most of all, that was his home  on hot nights, a good place to drink and play cards, and tell the stories not fit for women or children to hear. Behind the bar, near hidden by thick brush, was our road to the sea.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Old man *<i class="calibre5">Fama</i>, who was ninety, maybe more was riding into the hills, on the back of his mangy mule that struggled up the slight grade behind us, once losing its footing, nearly throwing the old man. Fama and his whole family are hated in the village (the men, their women and children, no matter). This man, himself, was a braggart a liar. “<i class="calibre5">Cinquanta anni fa</i> ,” fifty years ago, he would start every story to any fool who would listen, with these words, “The famiglia di Fama once owned this village.” To see him now, like this, old and broke, holes in his pants, is one of the few pleasures in my life. Today, he wears rags and owns nothing, but his shabby mule, not worth a lira and a hole to bury it. Their family had the power, but the father chose poorly in a battle of politicians, acting recklessly, when he threw his support behind the wrong man, and his family lost everything; the land, their money (most of it stolen from other people). Now he is like me, but old, near death. Do I enjoy his pitiful condition?  Si, yes, very much. Have I already said it? If so, I will say it again. His pain is my pleasure to see. I knew him. I know he ached for the old days, the way he treated his workers, like cattle; my father, one of them.     </p>
<p id="page_144" class="calibre6">“Did you work hard today?” he would say, like a joke, but it was not.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, I did, signuri. I give a good day’s work.” Fama counted the bushels. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“As hard as you could work, all day?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not all day, signuri. The sun. It was ungodly. I almost passed out.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Fama shook his head, in disgust.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then I can only pay as much as I should for the time you worked as hard as you could.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">They say he sang the same song when the workers came for their pay.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You picked fifty, you say? But *<i class="calibre5">Gessini</i>, my foreman, counted forty. Do you cheat me? No, of course not, the poor bastard would say, while he shits his pants.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then its forty, take it or leave it,” Fama said, spitting juice at this poor bastard’s boot. </p>
<p class="calibre6">They took it, always, and Fama would split the ten with Gessini; but he would fuck <i class="calibre5">Gessini, </i>giving him two, maybe three, and he did this until he found a new foreman, <i class="calibre5">Alberto Sciacci</i>, who cheated the workers as good, or better, but never took a cut, thankful for being with the boss. We heard one day, that Fama bullied the wrong worker, a young boy and a good picker, with a bad fault, that he could count as good as the overseer. The boy protested that he was being cheated; they roughed him up, not too bad, and threw him off the farm, warning not call the law, as if it would do any good. Fama’s oldest brother, Bernardo, was a Captain in the Carabinieri; he hated peasants, calling us ignorant, only fit to be slaves. Anyway, the boy’s father could not fight the landowner, so he sought help from his cousin, a bandit by profession, who hated bosses more than being caught. He convinced the overseer a mistake had been made and the error was promptly corrected, but with no apology. But as a penalty for the short pay, the overseer gave up a few lire of his own and small piece of his left ear, cut cleanly with his own knife, a rusty blade he used when he traveled with Garibaldi. Fama hid in his villa until this bandit left, telling friends he was in bed with a bad stomach, from poor cooking by a lazy maid he should have fired long ago.          </p>
<p id="page_145" class="calibre6">Today, <i class="calibre5">Fama</i> is slumped over on the back of his old mule, but  as he passed, raised his head and nodded. he turned to us and nodded. I answered out of respect for his age, nothing more, but all the while praying he would fall off the mule and make it a great day.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca would not let him pass in peace. Not Luca.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is your fucking thief of a father still dead?” he yells to Fama, who was struggling to keep the mule on a straight path, while ignoring Luca’s taunt, or he was deaf and did not hear.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I should pull you off that god damned mule,” he says to Fama. Did Fama hear Luca? They say he is near stone deaf but he stopped and spit on the ground in front of Luca, who reached for Fama and grabbed his leg, saying he would pull him off the mule.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Let him go,” I said. “Soon he will be dead with the rest of his family.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He let go and Fama kicked and moved on.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca says I am like a priest; he calls me Patri, the priest, when he is drunk.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old men joke there are two ways down the mountain. On foot to the bottom, or wrapped in a white cloth, and carried to the gate of the old cemetery by six men. We are, maybe, two thousand feet above the sea. On foot, carried, or slung over the back of a mule, it is a treacherous path, and I know men in the village who have never done it; not been off the mountain for a long time, a few never. Every turn is blind, on a path three mules’ wide, at best, with no rail or fence and to slip is fatal, as the fall will be straight down to rocks below. The road was built to be dangerous, they say, a thousand years ago, as a defense against invaders from the sea. Many have died on this road. The last, as I recall, was two Easter’s past. The <i class="calibre5">Fedele’s</i>, distant cousins, lost two brothers, a good mule and a cart over the side. They were returning from Nizza, on the sea, after selling a load of dried figs at the market, for a good price, according to <i>Signuri Anastasia, who witnessed the transaction and was impressed. They carted olive oil up the mountain, to sell and double their money. It was dusk and the boys were in a hurry to get off the road before night. </i><i class="calibre5">Signora Bellacastro</i>, sitting in the overlook, passing time, as her bread baked in the outside oven, saw the accident and described it to the grieving mother. Near the top of the mountain, where the road is most treacherous, the axle cracked on the old cart, and it lost a wheel and slid on the loose rocks, rolling over the side, taking with it the mule, kicking and flailing as it tried to throw off the reins.  One of the boys, she could not say who, foolishly grabbed at the mule, while the other reached for the cart, trying to stop its slide.  Both boys joined the mule and cart over the side, down over a hundred feet into a crevice, and this was their bad luck, as it was the worst hundred feet on the mountain. Five brave men spent two days(with no pay, the mother was broke) retrieving her boys for burial in the family ground. Their necks were broken, both arms and legs and faces mutilated, as they landed headfirst onto the sharp rocks. The mules, the cart was left at the bottom; in a month the carcass was picked clean, and in a year the cart had rotted away, leaving mostly rusted iron. The boys were pulled from the ravine with a long hemp rope, made from five single lengths, and their bodies were laid in the piazza, wrapped in wool blankets to hide their mutilations (the first night animals picked at their flesh, as they had been softened by the fall).  *<i class="calibre5">Assunta Morano</i>, the distraught mother, stood over her sons, cursing their reckless nature(like their father) for losing the cart and all the goods, mostly for dying and leaving her alone. Her brother, an honored priest from Catania, did his best to comfort her with religious words, but she cursed him when he called it “God’s will,” for all to hear, as his sister wept over the open grave. “They are with God,” he promised, but the mother blasphemed as the boys were lowered into the ground, one on top of the other. The oldest boy first. I forget his name.   </p>
<p id="page_147" class="calibre6">“My beloved sister is overcome with grief,” her brother, the priest, told the mourners, but he would pray for their soul and her soul and give her counsel that she might receive forgiveness before her own death.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The road is treacherous, as I said, up it or down, not to be taken lightly.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca demanded we go down the side, using an old goat path now overgrown with weeds and thick brush, full evergreens and jagged rocks and a wolf, maybe two. When he asked I said  my piece. “A fool’s way,” and I wanted no part of it. Luca swore the path was hidden, not visible from anywhere on the mountain. I voted for the road, safer, I thought, from falls and other accidents. But Luca stood his ground, picking the path, for the adventure of it and nothing else. Santo heard rumors from a drunk in the piazza, that <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>(bandits) were camping off the road, waiting to beat us and take what we had. He voted with Luca, and I lost. It was over the side.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This foolishness is your idea,” I said. “You go first.” He laughed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you think I am afraid?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Afraid? Not afraid. But foolish.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Now the sun was higher in the sky, and the air warmer and wetter than in early morning. Luca started down and immediately lost his footing on the first step over the wall, sliding nine, ten feet, on loose stone, but he grabbed a branch on a small tree and jerked to a stop. The trees, for this time of the year, were bare, stripped of leaves, except the evergreens, leaving no place to hide from the wind and heat. Luca recovered and shook off a minor injury, a scratch or two and minor bruises. He brought us along this narrow goat path, that was overgrown and seemed to be the longest way, as he said it would be, but passable. We come to the first turn, where the path doubled back toward the mountain top, for no reason but to miss a steep ravine. We come onto a flat rock, much like a table, in the middle of a clearing and we rested though we were gone less than an hour. The sun dazzled off the blue green sea, like specks of glass in the light, and I looked away to clear the glare from my eyes. Behind and above us, and to the right, the peak of Monte Etna, with at least two or three feet of new snow, or so it looked. White smoke and ash from her crater raised straight up to heaven, like an offering.    </p>
<p id="page_148" class="calibre6">We were alone, it seemed, as we saw no other travelers on the path, and this pleased Luca, who did not care for people he did not know. No sooner did I think this thought, when from our right came a frightening sound, like the cry from something dying(an animal), that did not want to die. We should have ignored it, but Luca wanted to see, as the noise was ringing in his ears, and he said he would hear it for hours unless it was quieted. We struggled through the brush, moving toward the sound. Luca was right, a goat, not a big goat but one wounded and trapped in the crevice of two rocks, twisting violently to free itself, and keep alive. Luca covered his ears and turned away. Santo was a herder in his youth; he looked close at the goat, saying it was done for, no more than wolf bait. The poor bastard looks at me, straight in the eyes, and I turn away, like Luca did. What could I do?  It cried like a baby, and I could feel it suffer and what if it was me in the crevice of the rock, but did I have the guts to end its suffering.        </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “You are too sentimental,” papa always said to me. Another man would have seen a goat for the taking, that’s all. A few good meals and a pair of boots. Maybe a hat.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Patri Carmine preached, “Life is hard, more turmoil that peace. Suffering is part of Gods plan for us and we are judged on how we accept this suffering.” I believe this included goats and other animals.   </p>
<p id="page_149" class="calibre6">I knew Luca would not tolerate this suffering goat for long. He climbed onto the rocks and leaned into the crevice, being an arm’s length from the goat, who thrashed violently, wanting to be free.  Luca pried away a chunk of rock from the mountain side, and without a second thought or hesitation, he struck the animal hard across the head, then again. *<i class="calibre5">Morte</i>. Dead. Luca had done the dirty work. For me, it would have laid there until the wolves finished it off.  I am a coward that way.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“There,” he said, as if bashing the head of a helpless goat was a life accomplishment.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I broke its goddamned neck, I think. Does it look like I broke its neck?” We watched it struggling to stay alive, breathing heavy as every bleat was weaker, until nothing and it stopped moving and closed its eyes. Luca cursed the goat and rubbed dirt on his hands to soak up the blood.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The wolves eat tonight,” he said, almost with joy. We stared at the dead goat, but said nothing, then started down the mountain, grabbing branches, stepping lightly on the loose stone. My leg muscles started to burn from the strain of twisting around the rocks and trees. Santo yelled, “something is moving…in the brush.” He was frantic about it, and in truth he scared me. We froze. Luca picked two rocks off the trail, one in each hand, with his right hand cocked to strike. A fat and fury animal wobbled from the bush, grunting and coughing, sniffing at the wind, turning away when it saw us. Luca sighed, dropping both rocks to the ground. Santo stretched and yawned, as he watched the animal, a fat, overgrown possum, that disappeared into a hole.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How much longer?” Santo asked for the third time. Luca pulled a rag from his jacket and wiped his forehead. “A while...a while…*<i class="calibre5">pazienza</i>, my friend.” Patience, he said.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">At the bottom of the mountain, near the edge of the sea, is the paese of <i class="calibre5">Ali Marina, </i>where we will catch the train from Siracusa, going to Messina. <i class="calibre5">Ali Marina</i> is no special Sicilian village, except for the natural springs flowing from deep in the mountain, where the lazy landowners and their lazy sons, the big shots from the city, come here to soak their lazy asses in the hot, and they say, soothing water. Soaking adds years and strength to their lives, and for me, it is the reason these bastards live forever, and pass their wealth on from father to son, forever. We pushed our way through a thick stand of evergreens and come on a small clearing, as I felt the wind turn off the mountain and the smell of it changed, and I gagged.           </p>
<p id="page_150" class="calibre6">“That smell?” Luca cocked his head back, nose sniffing at the wind, like a hound.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Pigs. Goddamned pigs.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">No more than a hundred feet from where we stood, to the right, near a patch of oak trees, a dozen squealing pigs, prisoners in a depilated pen, fighting, as they gnawed the ground for scraps. The sea air, so fouled by these creatures, that I near threw up, but I held my breath and buried my nose until the feeling went away. The pigs were tended by two boys, maybe ten and twelve, who threw garbage into a rusted trough, most of it, the slop fell to the ground, mixing with mud and the pig shit. The two boys were filthy looking creatures, one worse than the other, and both worse than the pigs they tended; they were dressed like beggars but seemed good natured and happy in their work. There was no house or shack we could see, and I figured they squatted in the nearby woods. Maybe they were on their own. It was possible. Did it make a difference?      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Buonjiorno,” I yell, loud enough for them to hear over the squealing. They stopped and whispered between themselves, before the taller boy answered.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you men hunting?” he asked, though we showed no weapons.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The game hunted us,” Luca answered.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The older boy seemed confused. “<i class="calibre5">Che cosa</i>? The game hunted you. Are you <i class="calibre5">ubriaco</i>?” </p>
<p id="page_151" class="calibre6">“Go back to your pigs,” Luca yelled and made a quick step toward them.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Don’t make me come over there,” he said, and they jumped back. The oldest of the ragamuffins, the mouthy one, walked boldly into the clearing. “<i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo </i>to you,” he said, the smart-ass little bastard. They laughed together, and this pissed Luca, and he moved at them with fists clenched fists, like two loaded guns.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo</i>? <i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo?</i> I will show you <i class="calibre5">va' fa' un culo</i>, you sonofabitchs.”  I grab his arm as he passed me, and pulled him to a stop, surprised he did not resist,  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Leave them alone. We have a train to catch.” He backed off, but not down. Never down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will see you two again,” he said, as he quickly raised the middle finger on his right hand to the heavens. They laughed all the more, taunting him. To their credit, neither moved an inch, and they appeared to have no fear, or very little fear.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Come and get us, old man,” they say together, like a song, repeating it many times. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Come and get us, old man. Come and get us, old man. Come and get us, old man.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Cavones</i>,” they said. Finally, Luca’s blood boiled over with anger. He repeats his threat, that he would see them again one day.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Again, “<i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo</i>,” the older boy yells, as they backed away, closer to the woods; I believe they were ready to escape. He gives Luca the finger and they disappear. It was near noon, or half an hour either way, as the sun was straight up in the sky. But for Luca’s battle with the boys, a few cuts and bruises from the trees and rocks, our trip over the side went well, but saving, at best, only a few hours, though Santo claimed victory, that we had not been jacked by <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>.    </p>
<p class="calibre7">The streets of <i class="calibre5">Ali Marina</i> were wide, in good repair. Three horse carts pass easy in opposite directions, four if one driver has the sense to move to the side of the road. Two men shared a bench and a bottle of wine; they were poorly dressed, like the boys tending the pigs, and I think, maybe, all was not well in Ali Marina. Santo stood by the bench until the oldest of the two looked up, with a question on his face.  </p>
<p id="page_152" class="calibre6">“What do you want from us?” he said, squinting too much wine and the sun in his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“When does the train to Messina comes through?” Luca asked. </p>
<p class="calibre6">The old man seemed confused by the simple question; he poured wine for his partner, spilling a full cup on the ground, and he cursed at Luca.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“God damn…you made me spill good wine…what do you want?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo asked again. “The train to Messina, Signuri?  When does it stop?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh, the train? Due ore,” he said, staring at the spilt wine. Two hours. “Forse,” Maybe.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Forse” is not a good thing to hear in Sicilia.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Forse? What do you mean?” I asked.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Forse. That is what I mean by ‘forse.’ He looked up.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Everything here is ‘forse.’ You do not live in Sicilia, signuri?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo pointed to the mountain. “Si, of course. Up there.” Both men laugh.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So up on your mountain, nothing there is ‘forse?” He smiled.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Basta</i>. Enough god dammed riddles.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I tired of listening to all four, figuring to find information on my own, but I turned and watched the sea, instead. I admit I was distracted by the brilliance of it, and the sweet smell of salty air, so confused I tripped over a rock and fell into a ditch filled with filthy water, near up to my waist. Shit-smelling, and gagging run off from the mountains. Santo and Luca laughed, with the two derelicts from the bench. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Only a fool would miss a ditch wider than the <i class="calibre5">Torrente Fiumedinisi,” </i>Luca said, but he did lean over and offer a hand and pulled me out. As soon as my feet hit dry land, I run to the <i class="calibre5">spiaggia</i> and charged into the waves. The water was cold, but it felt good, numbing my many aches and cleaning the shit and the sludge from my pants and boots, though I did not feel like a “new man” as the Americano’s enjoy saying, whether it is true or not. <i class="calibre5">I feel like a new man</i>. Bullshit. Only a “new man” can feel like a “new man.”  A tall wave come in and knocked me down and I swallow half the sea. I struggled to get steady on my feet, and when another big one knocked me back down, I give up and crawled toward the shore. “Come in. Get wet,” I yell to both men, who were safe on the beach and laughing. Luca kicked the sand and laughed.  </p>
<p id="page_153" class="calibre6">“Why would a man choose to be wet, when he can be dry.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I had no good answer. My feet and legs were numb to the knees from the cold sea water, like ice from the icehouse in Messina. I limped to shore and dropped onto the warm sand. I rub my legs and arms and feeling started to come back. Santo said he heard the faint sound of a train, so we crossed the road and waited under a solid oak, standing, maybe ten, fifteen feet from the track. After fifteen minutes of waiting, no train, and this did not surprise me because all Sicilian trains are late. if they come at all. Schedules are not promises, but a “forse.” A maybe.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The walk down the mountain, fighting trees and brush and rocks, had taken all my strength. I felt this gnawing in the pit of my stomach, and I remember the food mama packed in my haversack, that was still dry, thank God. Enough for two days, the time it would take us to reach Napoli, and after that we eat boat food for the next two, three weeks(I believe there is food on the boatI was sure of it, but I never asked the drummers who sold us the tickets, as if they would tell the truth, once Luca threatened to beat one senseless). Maybe we should have brought food for the whole trip. Another <i class="calibre5">forse </i>No. Not needed. Of course, they will feed us. It only makes sense.  </p>
<p id="page_154" class="calibre6">“Santo. This train you heard…where is it?” He shrugged.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My mistake, Antonino. I guess I am too anxious.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">No train, he says. His mistake.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I open my haversack and grab the food mama packed and lay it on the ground close to me. A nice piece of bread, all browned, hard, and a cut of cheese wrapped in oiled cloth; a small bottle of olive oil, a gift from *Signora Rizzoli, who mama nursed to health after the last epidemic. A sad time for all of us. There were many deaths, but not Signora Rizzoli, and it was all to mama’s gentle care. The olive oil, that was certainly fresh; a pleasing green and it was clean, no shit floating in the bottle. A small flask of water, should we find none on the road, and now I believed a small flask would not be enough. I had too little to share. I count on my friends’ good sense for their own welfare. I watch Santo and Luca from the corner of my eye; they sat on the same rock, looking lost. Should I ask, did they bring food, or do I share what I had?  What fool travels without food? Ok. I see. Thank God they brought something. Santo had bread and wine, but no cheese. I will not share my cheese should he ask. I hope he does not ask. Luca has cheese and olive oil, nothing else, no wine, or water, or bread. They planned poorly, but good enough to spare me the burden of denying a friend. We ate as we waited; for me, I ate only the crumbs and a sliver of cheese, and a swig of water, saving the rest for another time.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">The sea calms me, like a glass of good wine, or laying in the sun, thinking about things that do not disturb me. If I came back to this spot in a thousand years, the same waves will be pounding on the same rocks and sitting where I am sitting now will be a man like me saying the same thing about the sea. The same. The same. Always the same. I do not respect change, but I scorn change and hate it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The train is late and that is a good sign of bad luck; maybe we should go home.  </p>
<p id="page_155" class="calibre6">Thank God for Carmela. The joy in my life.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you think, Luca?  Do you see the beauty here?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe. Some of it,” he said. “But bird shit covers everything, ruining most of it.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">The three of us had been educated in the same schoolhouse, no roof or windows, by the heat of the boiling sun, and the capu’s boot stuck in our asses. I finished my feast of breadcrumbs and olive oil, and took a guzzle of water to wash it down. Where is this goddamn train? If it’s coming like they said, it should be here by now.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">My legs ached from the walk down the mountain side. Was I an old man, already? We were only two, three hours out.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Rest your eyes</i>,  Antonino. I believe I fell off, thinking of home and Carmela.               </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sparacino…Antonino Sparacino?  Is it you? Who dragged you off the god damned mountain?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I raise my head, startled by this voice, and shielded my eyes from the sun. I turn to fast, too hard and I feel this snap; hot pain shot through my neck, into my ears. I see him standing over me, and too close, a figure of a man, pants rolled up to the knees, fishing pole in his right hand. Or a rifle and I am still half asleep. Then I am dead. We are all dead and what is there to worry about?      </p>
<p class="calibre6">He slapped his cap against a tree.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Get up. You are still a lazy sonofabitch. How can you enjoy this beautiful day on your back,” and he said it loud, so the dead could hear? I turned away from the sun. that was at his back and blinding me.        </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Aspetta</i>. Son of a bitch. Is it him? Maybe. It looks like him. It sounds like him, the cavone that he is. Si. It is him. *<i class="calibre5">Gennaro Fiorini</i>, but he is dead, they say. He leaned over me, so close I could touch his face, that I might have done just to see if it was real or a dream, but he smelled like goddamned fish. The sickening smell churned my innards, pushing bile into my mouth.   </p>
<p id="page_156" class="calibre6">He stared holes in Santo and Luca. “Where are your shovels?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca and Santo shrugged. Shovels? What did he mean? </p>
<p class="calibre6">He was a nervous man, fidgeting when he talked. He looked around, over his shoulder and back again, like a man who might be on the run. I look at Santo and Luca, they each shook their head. Who is he? He looks familiar. But who?  Shit. It is. <i class="calibre5">Gennaro Fiorini</i>, that sonofabitch, the storyteller, a bad liar, a prevaricator, a deceiver and a fabler, as Patri Carmine said of him. “Ah, shovels…you made a joke,” I said, confused, that while he did not look good, he did not look dead, but who has seen him in years, and ‘dead’ is the story his family told the village.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Gennaro is dead. God rest his soul,” his father said it many times, his head always bowed, and he would make the sign of the cross, for those men who would not believe in his  sincerity. .    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Morte. Dead,” his father added, sometimes crying, but mostly he stared away at the sky, waiting for some poor bastard to ask “how,” and “when,” and “where,” maybe “why” if he was a real fool. I worked the fields with four Fiorini’s, each more <i class="calibre5">cavone</i> than the other, and I can say Gennaro was the worst of all, and I never called him friend. It was, maybe, five, six years ago, the last time I see him. I remember the day, so hot the sun cooked flesh right to the bone. The boss (I forget his name) was on Fiorini’s ass all day, because he went into the woods, five or six times, to take a piss, but mostly to get out of the god damned sun. The overseer (foreman) catches Fiorini in the woods laying under an old chestnut, his eyes closed. They fight. “You lazy bastard,” he says to Fiorini, who had enough and throws his shovel at the boss, barely missing his head. I remember what Gennaro said, that he was “tired of the horseshit,” that he was going to America to join his brother. “Tired of the horseshit?” What did that mean? He left, he walked away, and I have not seen him until today. For some years there were rumors, that he was in the lockup, or worse, prison, and I believed it, considering his fits of temper. Another story: he struck it rich in America, but the bandits robbed him and cut him, killing him when he resisted. Fiorini? Rich? I never believed it, but his family pushed this story, pridefully that he fought off three bandits, but he was spent and could not best the fourth. They told the story often and each time he was richer than the last time and fought off more bandits every time; the last time it was seven or eight, armed with guns and knives. They said it to friends and strangers and kin from other villages, so many times men fled when they saw a Fiorini coming their way. In the end, the story died from the monotony of it, even among strangers who knew nothing of the incident, and no one told it anymore. Then, and I am glad of this, he disappeared from our minds, as if he never existed. Gone, like a puff of smoke, blown away by a gust of wind.    </p>
<p id="page_157" class="calibre6">What I hated about Fiorini, and this will make me seem simple minded, but he is tall, and when I stood near him, I felt a lesser man, and he would look down at me and laugh and make some bad joke. But now, as this cavone stands over me, I see he is stooped, like a cripple, weak looking and I will have no problem talking to him…being his equal.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You look good,” I say. “For a dead man,” and at that Luca stepped up.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“That’s right, pisano. We heard you were dead,” he says and shit I could not hear, but whatever he said the two men starred each other down. Fire eyes. At the last “dead” Fiorini pounded on his chest with closed fist. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Dead? Me? Dead? Not yet. But more than one has tried.” Santo and Luca turned their backs.      </p>
<p id="page_158" class="calibre6">“I am still kicking,” he said, and I hear Luca laugh and this made Fiorini nervous.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">These two share a nature, that each will fight for nothing, no reason, except Fiorini never  had the muscle to win, and now, for what reason, he looks half dead. The two fought once, over…I cannot remember…, but Luca kicked his ass, good, and *<i class="calibre5">Bernardo Stenzanno</i> swears Fiorini ask for mercy, though I do not believe it, or do I believe Luca would give it.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Fiorini brushed sand from his pants. “But, uh, to be honest, time has softened me, some. I admit things that made me crazy, well, they no longer bother me. I have seen too much violence, and when I pray, I pray for peace and quiet.” He swished at a fly, or a sand flea, buzzing his right ear.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where are you men going?” he asks, politely, I admit. “Out for a walk?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. No walk,” I said. “To Napoli…then a boat to America.” He laughed, some, and shook his head, slowly, like inside he saw poor bastards standing before him and felt sorry for our trouble. I really hated this sonofabitch.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ah, si. America, of course. Always a dreamer, Antonino. How about the other two?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I closed my eyes and asked of God a favor. “<i class="calibre5">Mio Diu</i>,” make him disappear.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo and Luca walked away, like two rude men, and this upset Fiorini.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">He sniffed the sleeve of his shirt. “Do I stink?” he asked. “It’s the fucking fish, not me.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Few cared for Fiorini; his big mouth, his sloth and the lies he told with a straight face. Mostly it was the women, more the young girls, who were drawn to him, and this I could not understand. He was a dog in heat.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you think you will you find in America,” he asked me.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Was it his business? I refused to answer.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He stretched and groaned, “My body is one big sore,” he said.   </p>
<p id="page_159" class="calibre6">“I was there, you know,” he said without emotion. “In America.” As if it was across the street. “But now I am back, still poorer than dirt. But I found my calling.” He rattled his pole. “Pesce…fish. I love their sweet smell, and the fight when they struggle to flee the hook. Good as money. One fish, one lira. Two fish, two lire. Now, it is their turn to suffer.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">His face twitched, like a man with a bad conscience, or no conscience, or a sick man. The sweat rolled off his forehead in rivers; he seemed uncomfortable from it but did not wipe it away.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He cleared his throat, in a way that annoyed me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I can help you, Ask me about America. Anything. I know everything about America.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">The arrogant sonofabitch. Where is this god damned train?  I refuse to suffer this cavone alone. “Santo, Luca…<i class="calibre5">vienne ca</i>… come here.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">They were both looking into the blue sky, ignoring me, grinning like two fools.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Suddenly, they came out of nowhere, two cops, Carribieneri, long, decorated rifles slung across the shoulders, and riding high on chestnut mares. When the biggest mare reared, the cop, who seemed a good horseman, calmed her easily. She turned gracefully in a circle and stopped and made a deep breathing sound. He dismounted, held her nose while he spoke to her, and checked the hooves for stones. Yes, a good horseman, for a cop. I give him that, the way he stroked her forehead until she was calm and steady, but he never took his eyes off of us. He handed the reins to his partner; they spoke a few words and he walked our way, sharply, like the Carribieneri do so well. A third cop, an older man who seemed in charge, joined with him before he went ten steps. Both were stern looking, with a military walk and bearing, and these men never smile and are capable of anything. In the commotion Fiorini disappeared, into the brush, I think. I was cornered. One man in front, the other at my back. “Who was I and where was I was going and why was I going there,” they asked, while checking around the tree and the bush and the edge of the woods.  Me and Santo took out our papers, though they did not ask, but they looked us over and seemed satisfied we were not dangerous , or on the run. The old cop, a sergeant, asked me, did I have a cigar, even one half smoked. Half smoked? Wet by another man’s spit? I see it in my mind and the sight disgusted me.  </p>
<p id="page_160" class="calibre6">“*<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiace</i>, I do not smoke,” and I tell him my lungs are bad since birth, but he shut me down with a quick wave of his hand, and he looks at Santo and Luca.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And my two friends do not smoke,” I said, like a meek little man. He points to the trees at the edge of the mountain trail.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The other man, the one who walked into the woods. Do you know him?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I stuttered, like some old, drunken fool, ready to shit his pants.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Years back. We worked the farms near Palermu, but I have not seen him for years, until today.” He slapped his leather riding gloves across his bare hand, and I believe it was a signal to me, that he did not believe what I said, that I was lying and he had all the power and I had none,   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tell Fiorini, when he comes out of hiding…tell him this, he must see Sergeant Rinaldi at the *questura, tomorrow by noon. If I am not there, he is to wait. We have things to talk about, and lucky for him today is a bad day for me, and I am too tired to chase some cavone into the woods…tell him that.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded. I would.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">He mounted the mare he handled so well and dug his spurs into her flesh; she circled once and they rode off, and to my surprise I had not shit my pants. Santo and Luca said nothing as they walked around the tree, and we went about our business, but my hands were sweating, and my neck. Fiorini, in about ten minutes comes out of the woods, holding a stick in his right hands, beating the bushes, like a crazy man, and he walks to the edge of the road, looking left and right to be sure the cops were no longer around.    </p>
<p id="page_161" class="calibre6">“Basta, Carribieneri,” he said. “Good riddance,” and he spit on the ground.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This sergeant. He ordered you to the <i class="calibre5">questura</i>. Are you in trouble?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He looked guilty; he coughed and spit to the ground and took a deep breath.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You said he was looking for me? Why would he be looking for me? If they want me…here I am. Fuck the Carabinieri.” He stutters, some, and mentions, maybe there was a question over money he might owe to a landlord, who himself, was a liar and crook, like all landlords, and he lied to the cops, claiming tools were missing when they were not. But no worry, Fiorini said, as it was a minor disagreement, he would easily straighten it out when he had the time.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You hid from them. Why?” I asked, only that I was curious. He laughed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hid? I do not recall hiding.” He looked from the corner of his eye. “I went into the woods to take a piss, that’s all.” He paused. “But let’s talk about America. I can tell you everything you need to know, but it is likely you will not like what I say.” He looked at our faces, and I believe he expected to see surprise, but he saw none, He tugged on his right ear. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Ascoltti</i>,” he said. “Listen close, and I will teach you about this world you go to with a fools dream of a better life.” He wiped his forehead and asked for water, and if we did not have water, he would take wine if it was not sweet wine, or bad wine soured by the heat. “No wine,” I said, and our water canteens were empty and would not be filled until we reached Messina.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No matter,” he said. “But I wished you had wine.” He smiled. “Or you are only saying you have no wine.” He stared at Santo, who looked away.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No matter,” he said again, and I believed he was sincere, that it did not matter to him.  </p>
<p id="page_162" class="calibre6">He started with the steamer to America, the bad food that made the passengers sick, except first class and there was very little of it and the men would send their women to beg food for the children.  The crew was German, and who hated Italians more; Siciliani to the very last man. And what he found in America were horrible conditions, far worse than anything here. This was hard to believe, and I said so, but he shrugged me off and went on, with what I believed might be lies, or exaggerations,           </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They hate us,” he said, his head down. “We are wops, dagos, not even human.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Wops? Dagos? These words meant nothing to me, except I knew they were bad, and insulting, as I could tell by the tone in his voice. Wops. Dagos. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Today, I know these words like I know the back of my hand and my own name.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Wops and dagos,” he repeats the ugly words, as he kicked the ground.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You and me...we are wops, dagos. Your cousin and Luca. Dirt under their fingernails and shit on their boots.” He looks me in the eyes. You too,” he said. “Wops...low class human beings and lazy...I hated Americans…all of them. And you, my friend,” he pointed to me, with a crooked finger, that looked like it had been broken. “You will hate them, too, if you are prideful like a good Sicilian man.” I admit, his tone, his sharp words hit me to the core of what I am, though he has always been the best of liars and I should have paid him no mind. It is his nature to lie, but could I swear he was wrong?  Many men come home, I know this, but many stay. Then is it heaven, or is it hell, or is it neither of the two?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He moved closer to me and called for Luca and Santo to come and stand with us, and they did, for whatever reason.  “Judge what you hear for yourself, like a man.” He grabbed at the lapel of my coat. “<i class="calibre5">Ascolti</i>,” he said it loudly. “Listen well. What I say may save your life…if that is important to you.”   </p>
<p id="page_163" class="calibre6">Luca stepped between us and challenged Fiorini. “No, no. We go to die, like dogs.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Fiorini smiled. “Luca, right? Si. I remember you, but not as a funny man. It has been a long time.” I pulled back and he let go of my lapel.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This story you have?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. The story. You want the story. Curiosity? Does it kill you, like it kills a woman?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca stepped towards him. “Tell your goddamned story or…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Pazienza</i>, signuri Ponto,” he said, stepping back a few steps. “You like to fight. Si, I remember this, too. But me, I have tired of it, and I refuse to fight, no matter how much I am provoked,” and at this Luca backed off and waited.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Fiorini complained on the heat, taking a cloth from his back pocket and wiping his forehead dry. “It was in America, in the south where the weather is like here, and this is why we go there...the fucking snow in the north, stay away from it, like the plague.  Anyway, a mob of men, crazy, lawless bastards, drunked up on liquor – these people do not drink wine – but they were sober enough to lynch a dozen innocent Siciliani men…murdering them for no reason. These Siciliani were set free, let off, by the American jury of killing some cop, or a sheriff, but it made no difference to this riffraff.” He wiped his forehead, again, with the sleeve of his shirt. Luca and Santo were showing interest in what he said, about hanging innocent Siciliani for no good reason.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They broke into the jail and dragged these Sicilian men out and hung them and mutilated their bodies. Innocent men…the jury said they were innocent. The American newspapers said this animal mob did the right thing in putting the wops in their place.” He squatted and sifted a handful of sandy earth through his fingers, and the sea breeze blew some of the dust to the mountain.   </p>
<p id="page_164" class="calibre6">“As I say, these bastards hang at the docks, like the shit they are, with hate in their eyes, and when we come off the boat scared, not knowing where we are, they say, “wop go home,” and mean every goddamned word of it. They will insult our women, who they say are whores, <i class="calibre5">puttanu</i>, every one of them, including the female children. One day, for no reason, I was beaten like a dog and these bastards leave me in the street to die, bloodied. My money, my papers gone. And what did the cops say?  ‘Maybe you pissed them off…insulted them some way. Forget your complaint’ this cop says, ‘or you will make it worse.’ What did I do to earn this beating? I refused to give up my seat on a bench in a goddamned park when these bastards ordered me to leave. ‘It is our country…go back home,’ they yell in my face and when I tried to get up, they pushed me down. A goddamned seat...and three bastards tried to peel the skin from my head.” Fiorini parts the hair on his head, and we see a long, vicious scar, from his forehead to the back of his skull.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“When they beat me, the crowd cheered…derelicts and roustabout’s, nothing more. We are bugs to these people, not worth a pot of piss. I will starve before I go back. And to their fucking money and their fucking promises, I say <i class="calibre5">va' fa' un culo.”</i></p>
<p class="calibre6">What happens in this world, we never hear of it for months (unless it is war and then they come for us right away, to fight for their cause). We hear rumors, a cousin with a friend who said <i class="calibre5">this</i>, a brother-in-law who heard <i class="calibre5">that</i>. Stories told around a card table, after too much wine. Fiorini was beaten for refusing to give up his seat, but what is that next to the poor bastards hung because they were Siciliani? I rub my neck, thinking how a rope feels as it tightens, choking off my life, as I beg for another chance.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He grabbed his pole and turned toward the sea. “I have said enough to you men. By now you must think I am a fool, so I will leave you and go back to my fish.”  </p>
<p id="page_165" class="calibre6">Now he was calm, like a priest in his confessional.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Go to America, and <i class="calibre5">buona fortuna</i>,” he said, as he tipped his cap and bowed, that set me back, as bowing is not a masculine thing. I have never seen a woman bow, but it is something only a woman should do. I thought, maybe, it is possible that Fiorini has been sent to us as a warning, like an angel from God. What nonsense! The real thing, I know, is that I am asleep under that tree over there, and he is a dream, and I will wake at the sound of the train, and he will be gone, this god dammed nuisance.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Accura</i>,” he said, <i class="calibre5">be careful</i>, tipping his cap again, but not bowing from the waist, thank God, as it is too feminine for me to respect. He pointed to the sea.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Napoli is a long way from here, and should you make it, then you will travel to the end of the world.” He walked toward the beach, but suddenly stopped and turned to me. Quietly, in a whisper, he said, “Those bastards, the Carabinieri? If they come back, tell them I went into the mountains?” Luca took Fiorini by the arm.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I lie to the cops, any time and with pleasure.  More than once if you need it.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Fiorini smiled. “Grazie for this favor, and <i class="calibre5">arrivederci a tutti</i>.” We watch him walk away, calmly, back to the to the sea from where he came, dragging his pole in the sand, and finally disappearing into a pile of rocks that lined the shore. Santo shook his head in doubt.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“That was Gennaro Fiorini?  I thought he was dead. Murdered years ago?”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Killed in a fight, somewhere,” Luca said. “That’s what I heard.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo stretched his neck for another look. “We should follow him. If he is a real man, his will mark the sand. Who is with me?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Neither me or Luca moved, and Santo would not go alone. Scared children, and foolish like the old women we were, to think God worried about three peasants from the hills of Sicilia, enough to send an Angel disguised as a man we knew, so we would trust in what he said.  </p>
<p id="page_166" class="calibre6">Is there pain when they hang you by the neck, or just a quick snap like I have heard?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Who can we ask? Who will know the answer is already dead? Poor bastards. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No pain,” says Santo, and offered his reason, that you would choke to death with no air, that’s all and all sense and feeling would be gone.  No feeling, no pain. It made sense.  I recall I might have agreed with him.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca laughed. “You are half right,” he said. “No pain? You are fools if you think it is like a good cough…not at all…your neck is snapped and broken. You are not suffocated. First, there is pain when the rope tightens and at the instant before your neck snaps. Once that is complete, now you are both correct. There is no pain because you are dead. I see it done, in the army. It was a party. Some soldier from Roma murdered his wife, for what reason I do not recall. Some off the men joked you did not need a reason to murder a wife.” I see this sight in my mind; me, hanging and struggling to breathe, feet kicking the air, and if I could still think, I will wonder ‘how did I get to this place?’ Will I be able to scream with a rope tight around my neck?  *Signuri Paglia died by a rope or dangling at the end of it. But it was his rope and his choice, so it was not the same thing. Sunday, after mass, I pass him on Via Reggio. “Buonjiorno,” I said, but he ignored me (he hated my farther), and turned into the woods behind the piazza, carrying a small ladder, resting on his right shoulder. There was a bulge of something under his coat and now I believe I should have thought more of it. He was gone two, three days when his daughter went to the Carabinieri, and reported her father lost. I helped in the search. In a few hours we found him dead, swinging in the wind off a sturdy elm tree, a few hundred feet from where we passed. His neck, my God, stretched so long his feet near touched the ground; his body black and we thought it was covered in coal tar. No. He was dead, and the black was blood, they said. His daughter said he was dying and would not have lived through summer. Paglia was old, but always his own man and strong-willed and no one was surprised he chose the time and place of his own death. We guessed he did not know he would not be welcomed into the Kingdom of Heaven for what he did. But Patri promised the family he would pray for his soul, anyway, in the chance he was forgiven his sin. Me? I am a coward, and I intend to stay to the end, kicking and screaming, if only to heed the words of the priest. What fools we were then. Are we wise men now? <i class="calibre5">Chissà</i>? Who knows?          </p>
<p id="page_167" class="calibre6">Who is leaving, going home? I feel it, yes, in my bones. Maybe Santo, who has no fight in his guts. Papa said he would run at first chance. I should have left him on the mountain, cousin, or no. Since the day we agreed to this, his story has changed a thousand times, and he has gone from here to there and back again.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Lunedi. “Si, yes. Of course, I am going.  What did you think?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Martedi. “<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiace.</i> How can I leave my wife, Agatha, who is a sick woman?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Mercoledi. “She has recovered. It is a miracle.” Now he is ready to go.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Giovedi. His mother describes her dream to him, wherein an angel, dressed in white, speaks to her.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your son will be cursed for eternity, if he goes to America to live a sinful life.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Listen to the angel,” she pleads to her son. “Stay here. Save your soul.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Though she made a good argument to Santo; this dream and the angel dressed in white, he decided, in the end, he would go, because he was afraid not to go and be called a coward. Being called coward, for any reason, is like death to a man, and maybe we come back rich and without him and rub his face in the shit, and he still be a pauper. This Santo could not accept. </p>
<p id="page_168" class="calibre4">The night before we leave Santo was drunk; he confessed he thought his wife would not be faithful. I gave him comfort, as best I could, not being a married man. I believed she was <i class="calibre5">puttana</i> (but I never said it), instead I call him “<i class="calibre5">pazzo,” </i>swearing his wife was a woman of honor, “a pure and virtuous woman.” This I said to his face. “She would die before dishonoring your name.” The truth, as we knew it, except Santo, she would dishonor him before we made it to the piazza the morning we left. We are cousins, family, and I owed him this lie, but he is no stronger than a blade of grass in a good wind. I should leave him under the tree, without a second thought.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">It would surprise men and disappoint me if it is Luca, as he is a man God created never to surrender. What has he to lose? <i class="calibre5">Niente</i>. Nothing. He is a dangerous man, a wounded soldier and a man who has seen life off the mountain. A hard worker, a hard drinker, who enjoys a fight for no reason, for the pleasure of it, like other men enjoy a good meal. Women love him, old women and young girls, and behind his back men say he is “<i class="calibre5">un gatto randagio</i>,” a stray cat. His mother complains to the other women (and once to the priest) that Luca disappears for days, and she and her sister go to the Church and light a candle and pray to Santa’ Agatha for his safety. When he returns, his mother meets him at the door, and scolds him for the way he lives his life. “I go for long walks, that’s all,” he tells her, and hugs her, with a small kiss to the cheek, and they say no more about it. The ample young girl from Itala, we have seen her, is the reason for his long walks. It was near half a day to her doorstep by foot, but worth the time and the pain, he said to me. Was it my business? He says with a straight face, that it is a long walk, but he returns a better man, and he smiles. It is the long exercise, he says, the walk up and down the mountain, that makes a man a man. I believe very little of this bullshit. But he is fearless, and I admit this to any man; he never backs down, or runs from a fight, and never fears a punch in the face, or other pain. He has no fear of men’s fists, but their words, and what other men say of him now, that he left his sister and aged mother to fight for themselves. His father was dead, instantly, when he fell off a wagon and slipped under the wheels and his head was crushed, and they say this is the only time anyone saw Luca cry. Except for his time in the army, and his walks in the mountain, he has done a fair job and been honorable in caring for his sister and mother. But now he leaves them and in Sicilia a woman with no man is like a wounded lamb in a pack of wolves. Luca’s uncle, *Aldo Ponto, his father’s brother, was pissed when he heard Luca was going to America.  “This Foolishness is a betrayal of the family, especially your dead father,” he said.” A few later, they met on Via Roma and the uncle made known his feelings, as he is a loud man, like Luca, and tough like Luca, but Luca would not give in, or change his mind. They argued in front of a crowd, and the men who heard it said his uncle made sense, but the crowd wanted excitement and waited patiently for the punches to fly.    </p>
<p id="page_169" class="calibre6">“Who will put bread on the table?” his uncle demanded, shaking his powerful fist, an inch from Luca’s face.  He took a step back and stares at Luca. “How will they eat...do you expect me to support them?  They will starve or be held to the charity of others.” His arms flailed in the air. “And who will protect them from the thieves should those bastards demand money…or other things from your sister?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">There is no doubt Luca would have beaten on another man, as he will not tolerate criticism or disrespect. The crowd waited, as I said, expecting a fight, but out of respect for his uncle, Luca uttered not a word in his own defense.  Zio Ponto, embarrassed to be arguing family matters before the whole village, shook a defiant fist at the crowd waiting to see blood flow on the street. In the end, the good man that he was, zio agreed to help the women until Luca returned, out of respect for his dead brother. The women would have vegetables from zio’s garden and what they did not eat they could be trade for flour to make bread. Zio would lend them a goat, but not the best in his herd, so they would have milk to make cheese. They agreed not to kill the goat, or cause it injury, or give away anything made with the milk it gave, that it would belong to zio.   </p>
<p id="page_170" class="calibre6">Now his uncle asks, “Who will protect these women when you are gone?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Patri Carmine will pray for them, and God will protect them until I return. Would God deny Patri?” What could the uncle say, without seeming blasphemous and insulting to Patri Carmine in front of the whole commune? He accepted this statement because he had no choice.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Am I doing wrong?” Luca asked me. “Do I put myself before my mother and sister?” I gave him a shrug; What did I know?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">No, it will not be Luca to leave. If it is Luca, we are lost.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">It will not be me. I will not go back a failure. Who is with me?     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo cleared his throat; his hands shaking as he smoothed the brim on his cap.  He did not look me in the eye, and this scared me, some; instead, he gazed at the mountain top. The “gaze?” Was it a sign?       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Cugino,” I say, looking him straight on. “Say what’s on your mind.”  He lowered his head, like a meek little man would do and took a deep breath, that I could hear.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino.” He paused and looked way, and I took his arm and brought him back, so we stood face to face. “What are you thinking, Santo? Say it.” He did, finally. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I promised Agatha, my wife…no trouble. If we are set on by briganti, I vowed to her I would not resist, but run to safety. Now I am thinking, what do I have worth stealing?  But these stories, from Fiorini, even if half true, makes me believe maybe it is more dangerous there than here.  If my wife heard Fiorini…I believe she would demand I come home.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He still fidgeted with the brim of his hat, as he took a few steps back. </p>
<p id="page_171" class="calibre6">“But I am no coward. Is that what you think? That I am a coward.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. I have not said you are a coward.  Or do I think you are a coward, but…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am not a coward, but a practical man. These animals Fiorini talked about…what if they are all over America? They lynch Siciliani for no good reason. Did we make a bad choice?  But if I go back now, my wife, my mother will be thankful, yes, but behind my back the village will say I am a foolish man. Worse. A coward. Disgraced in front of the village after a few hours.  I need to think.” He walked a few steps toward the mountain, that looked like a picture in a picture frame. I remember *<i class="calibre5">Cantera</i>, who was a bad soldier, but a good artist, he drew pictures of mountains that hung on the barracks wall, and they made us think of home, even men from the city were homesick and this I could not understand, as the cities are cesspools. But “home is home,” papa always said.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo spoke quietly and I moved closer to hear his words.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“All I want is work…some money for a little farm.  Do I ask too much?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6"> Luca was resting against a tree, his hat pulled down and over his eyes, as he faked sleep, the sonofabitch. I hated his cap. If only I had the guts to knock that god damned cap off his head.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And what about you?” I ask Luca. “Do I go on alone?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He lifted his cap and squinted and turned away from the bright sun; the look on his face gave me no clue to his mind, that on any matter, from life to death, could change in the minute.  He would lie if it suited him or tell the truth if the truth would not harm him in any way. Whatever was in his mind, at any minute, he would say and make no apology for it. He points to the drunks across the road; one asleep, his arms resting across the back of the bench, as if he had been born to that spot, or painted onto it. The wine bottle had fallen from his hand and busted when it hit a jagged rock. His partner lay on a pile of wood and rocks, drunk as the first one, and fast asleep, snoring loudly, his chest heaving. Luca could only stare at thew heap of two men. </p>
<p id="page_172" class="calibre6">“Look at them. “A God damned waste of wine.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Forget the drunks…answer my question.  Are you going on with us?”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">With one arm (his stronger arm) he pushed himself off the ground. He is a tall looking man, not that he is tall, but he is slim and well-built, and this makes him seem tall. He faced me and opened his palms to the sky, like the painting of Jesus on the wall at Sant’ Agata’s.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “What do I have to lose? Nothing. Like my father…God rest his soul…he had nothing.  If I stay here, I will die with nothing, and they will throw my bones in the pit with the rest who have nothing, mostly people I hate. Not even a hole to call my own.”         </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But Fiorini. You heard him. What about his stories?”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Fiorini? That good for nothing? He is still pissed off for the time I kicked his ass good.” Luca stared me square in the eye. “And I think he is dead and come back to haunt us with bullshit stories.” Luca admitted he thought before, America might be a bad and violent place for men like us, but he asked questions and took advice from men he trusted. He knelt on the ground and pulled his knapsack close to his leg, as he looked over his shoulder.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am no hero…no matter what the young women say.” He laughed; said he was kidding, it was a joke; he was no hero, just not as afraid as some other men and that made him seem brave, but he was not. “Dangling at the end of a rope…not something I would enjoy. But when they come for me, if they come for me, I will bring a few of them to hell, if that is where I am going…and certainly it is…if there is a hell. Anyway, as I said, the advice I get from trusted men, is that I should bring extra muscle with me.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He stretched his neck and looked down the road.  </p>
<p id="page_173" class="calibre6">“The goddamned cops. Where are they?”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca kneels and pulls back the flap on his haversack, and with his hand he searches the inside of it. “Before they stretch my neck, a few of those bastards will beat me to the fires of hell,” he said, and slowly opened his hand, and shows this small pistol flat in his palm, that sparkled in the sun from the sweat of his hand. The pistol was an old piece of armament, more a relic, with dirty ivory grips and pits of rust on the frame and barrel. Not much of a weapon, as I could see, but Luca held it proudly, like a trophy.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Here, take it,” he said, “feel it,” and he pushes the pistol near to my face. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo sees the gun and goes crazy, grabbing his head in both hands, as if he was in terrible pain and he walked in circles, kicking at the dirt and cursing.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A gun? Why did you bring a goddamned gun?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why? Is this what you ask me? Why?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca says Santo is crazy, out of control and making no sense.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Protection from bandits. Why else would I bring a gun? You have seen guns before. You are shitting your pants and acting like an old woman.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">I admit and agree, Santo was acting like a woman, and at that moment, I was ashamed to be his cousin, but calmed, finally and began to make sense when he challenged Luca.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Bandits,” Santo yells it, spit flying from his mouth. “You are worried on bandits? These animals will steal your pistol and kill all of us with it…mark my words,” and he slapped at the air, cursing, foul and vulgar words, not like him.  He was so upset at the sight of Luca holding a pistol, I see his heart beating hard through his shirt. “I would not travel with this cavone to the end of the street,” Santo said, so loud a man leading a mule stopped and looked but moved on. Santo grabs his bag and started for the road, but Luca blocked his way.  </p>
<p id="page_174" class="calibre6">“Are you pissed at me for trying to protect you…it makes no sense?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. It is, if you are a dangerous and crazy man.” Luca shrugs it off, like it was no important thing. Santo walked around him and started to mountain. I called out his name.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Santo, aspetta, wait. Think of what you are doing.”  I take his shoulder, but he pulled away and double timed his pace down the road. Then he stops and turned and cursed like I had never heard him curse (even to taking the Lord’s name in vain).    </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">“Va' fa' un culo, Va' fa' un culo,” </i>he says loud enough, angry enough to wake the dead and the very ill. “This crazy bastard with a gun. This was not our plan.” He babbled foolishness, while he kicked loose stones from the road, repeating the same curse, “<i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo…va' fa' un culo.” </i>He cursed and when he come up hoarse, he stopped, thank God, and hung his head and I could tell (I know him all my life) he was ashamed of his bad conduct, though I did not fault him. Santo was always quick to apologize when he was wrong, or thought he might be wrong, or acted plain foolish.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Antonino, I am sorry for my foul language, but you know this crazy bastard will get us lynched. Dead. He will get us dead or prison, and what is worse?”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">I ask Luca, “The gun? Where did it come from?” This question, I see, annoyed him.    </p>
<p class="calibre6"> He holds this pistol in the air and looks it over.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What? This thing?” He laughed and broke it open, to show me it was not loaded (while holding four bullets in his other hand).   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is a gift from my zio,*<i class="calibre5">Enrico Ponto</i>, you know him. He claims these thieving bastards are all over the place. It is for our protection, that’s all. He made me swear to Sant’ Agata, I would not shoot anyone unless they deserve it, and to clean it good before I give it back to him. He won it in a card game, or he stole it a long time ago. I forget. What is it my business?”  Then I think to myself, maybe this is not so bad. His zio was trusted by all the men in the village, prosperous and generous, who succeeded in most of what he did, and he was no fool, or criminal.  Not a farmer or landowner, by birth, but a follower of the sea, that was his calling. But to be honest, he had poor luck with the sea, as bad construction, by incompetents, he said, but mostly pirates, accounted for three boats sinking from under his feet. He survived these catastrophes by hanging onto the wreckage, the last time for over a week, when finally the Germans took him out of the water, and he was near out of his mind, and he swore to them he saw the Blessed Mother in the waves, and on hearing this, four German sailors made the sign of the cross, so maybe they were Catholic Germans and not barbarians, as most of the Germans are. The Blessed Mother told Enrico he would be saved, but it was the only time she would come to his rescue, reminding him of his poor luck with the sea, and he remembers that it was at the exact moment of her apparition, he began to love the land, vowing to become a farmer, like our ancestors. He is the oldest in the <i class="calibre5">Famiglia di Ponto, </i>and their leader for that reason, but built his farm in <i class="calibre5">Termini Imerese</i>, near Palermu, miles away. The weather is better near Palermu, he says, hotter, more humid, and grape vines grow faster and taller and give better fruit that makes better wine. A few times each year he visits the village of his birth, to see family and renew friendships. He tells stories through the night, or until the wine runs out. He is a worldly man, they say, and this is his reputation, though he has never sailed outside the Mediterranean and was sunk in it three times.   </p>
<p id="page_175" class="calibre6">Since Zio Enrico give Luca the gun, I respect it as the right thing to do. </p>
<p class="calibre6">How do I calm Santos ragged nerves? I looked at him straight on.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then you are going back?” He said nothing.  “Listen to me and remember what I say. Today may be your last chance out.” He stared at the ground, shuffled his feet, and the sea wind blew loose dirt toward the mountain. “What can I say to you? The gun is for our protection. </p>
<p id="page_176" class="calibre4">From Zio Enrico Ponto. You know him. He is alright, not a foolish man.” Santo nodded, like a child.  I took him by the arm. “You have heard stories, about the Carabinieri stopping the boat from leaving Sicilia. They want to keep the <i class="calibre5">contadini </i>here until all the crops are picked. If you go home over some old pistol, you may be a prisoner there, maybe forever.”  He shrugged his shoulders and curled his lip, that looked to be swollen.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They cannot stop us all,” he said, thinking like a child.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They will not stop us. You need a boat to leave Sicilia...you need a boat to get to America. They will stop the boats and that will stop us. The end. Finito. <i class="calibre5">Capisce, il mio amico</i>?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> Santo glances toward Luca, “What about him?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I lower my voice. “Leave Luca to me…I will control him.” When I said it, that I would control Luca, it was my honest aim to try, but I was certain it could not be done easy, if done at all. He respected me, but would he listen to me.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Swear it.” Santo said. “Swear to God.” I raise my right hand.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I swear to God we will get to America in one piece, and no one will stretch the neck of my favorite cugino, even if he deserves it.” Santo nods and smiles. I put my hand on his shoulder, and now I believed everything would be all right with him, no matter how foolish he could be over meaningless slights.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Think about this,  in two years, maybe three… at the most…if things go right, we will have enough money to buy a little land in Sicilia. Is this not worth some risk? A little?”     </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Our own land,” he sighed, his eyes wide, like a child at his first festa.    </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “What a good thought, Antonino. No more capu,”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. No more capu.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was feeling what he felt, and I know Luca felt it, but he would not admit it, because being content is weakness to him. Our families? We leave them behind at their worst, their weakest, when we should stay to help them survive.  One year…two years…three years…forever?  But we hate this life, working other men’s land, the taxes, the disease. We love and cherish our family and would die for them, yet we are leaving them to chase some dream. A fool’s dream, some say. Children. Old people. The weak. We leave them behind and tell ourselves we save them by leaving them.      </p>
<p id="page_177" class="calibre6">Santo held on to the sleeve of my jacket. “I will go on. What choice do I have? I was born with no choice. How can I go back after a few hours?  What would I say to my wife? That Luca scared me. She will think I am a coward, and everyone else will say it behind my back. Everyone will agree.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The two of them, Luca and Santo stood face to face, like two men should stand when   they have disagreed, and my cousin Santo spoke first, with a ‘solemn promise’ he said, one he could not ever keep.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you hurt us in any way” he says directly to Luca, then he turns to me, “And Antonino, you are my witness…if I see that goddamnable pistol again …I will take it and you will never see  it again.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Why Luca did not laugh I never knew, but he stood quiet, almost a gentleman.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then we go!”  I said, loud and passionate, like Garibaldi would say it. “Forget this god damned Fiorini and his god damned fish. We will make it to America…but there is one thing that bothers me.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>?”  Santo asked. The bandits?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No.  Not the <i class="calibre5">briganti</i>.  But our packs? Are they big enough to carry the lire we bring back home?” Santo did not understand the joke, as he counted the haversacks, one, two, three. </p>
<p id="page_178" class="calibre4">He caught it, finally and we all laughed, and I thought that peace would be restored. Luca walked to the edge of the shade, under the tree where we stood, and stared at the sea. “What a beautiful sight,” he said, “and quiet and peaceful,” though the waves hit the beach hard making an ungodly roar. “Quiet and peaceful,” he said again. I never heard him speak so gently, like a woman would speak, about pleasant things and beautiful things, but this did not change my mind, that he must be watched and kept in a straight line, before it all falls apart and we will be the fools for it. My father said this, if you had a problem with another man, ‘speak to him like a Dutch uncle.’ I believe he meant ‘firm and forceful,’ but kind and caring, yet he never said it that way and I did not care to ask.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Santo is afraid of you,” I said to Luca, who thought it was correct.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But without good cause,” he said, as he pushed me away, and said other things about Santo, not kind things, about his manhood, that I would never repeat. Santo is softer than most men, but nothing should be made of his gentle nature. My brother Salvatore had a gentle nature and he died  for something he did not understand.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Santo is afraid of you…the pistol and the reckless things you have been known to do.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The pistol…” Luca stuttered. “The…the…the pistol… is for my protection,” he paused. “And for you, my friend. And him, too. We are looking into the lion’s mouth.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Will you behave yourself?” I asked him straight out,  hoping for the right answer. “No going crazy if someone looks at you the wrong way.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He raised his right arm in the air. “No fights, nothing…my right hand to God.” I was glad he said it, but it is said so often, what does it mean? I have said. “My right hand to God,” many times and it is just something you say and never mean it, but Santo says it and means it.     </p>
<p id="page_179" class="calibre6">“Shake hands, the both of you,” I demanded it and they did it, in a way.  Neither looked the other in the eye, so it was not a sincere shake, and neither seemed to feel right about, but I accepted it, as I did not want Santo to leave; I would have promised him my first born. If he left, then we were a sinking ship.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Andiamo,” I said, “we go...” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, we go,” they said it together, at the same time.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Across the road, six men, young and fit men, had showed and were waiting at the train stop, and I figured they heard the train; we took our bags and joined them, making us nine in all.  Four of the men carried packs, like us, and I guessed they were heading for America, too. We waited for the train like Sicilians do, with patience. We wait, but never think about waiting.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">An old man, maybe eighty years old, pulling a stubborn goat on a long rope, wandered to the middle of our crowd, and carefully lowered himself, grunting all the way, until his ass touched the ground. The goat pulled hard at the rope, and this angered the old man, who cursed for a minute straight.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Buonjiorno,” I said, tipping my cap out of respect for his age.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He ignored me, like I was nothing and kept battling with his mangy old goat.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">We waited, listening for the whistle to blow.   </p>
