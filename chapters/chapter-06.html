  <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Papa's Advice and the Taskmaster</h3>
  <p><em>Signuri Rao</em> is said to drink alone, that he loves his drink, and men I know claim they have seen him finish off a bottle of <em>grappa</em>, on a mere bet, without stopping for air; only to laugh and demand the loser buy him another bottle. Only a fool would believe this to be true, but it might be true, and if it is true, he is as tough as they say, a man to be approached carefully.</p>
  <p><em>Papa</em> knows him from picking, years ago, and recalls he was beaten bad by the overseer for some disrespectful remark, and he was never the same from that day, but keeping to himself, choosing not to speak when spoke to. He began to disappear from the village, for days at a time, at least once a month. “These <em>muratore</em> (masons), they are all drunks,” <em>papa</em> warned me. “The lime in the mortar makes them crazy, and for this they crave wine, more than cool water.” <em>Papa</em> said I should chose a public place, like the <em>Piazza</em>, when I confront <em>Signuri Rao</em>. “He buy’s his <em>grappa</em> at <em>Signuri Belotti’s</em> place. Get there first and wait. You will hold the better hand if he comes to you, and you will be superior, right off. He will not embarrass himself in a public place. Above all, show him respect. Get to him now and do not wait.”</p>
  <p>Tomorrow, I will see him for sure. Maybe the day after tomorrow, or the next week if I have work. Next week. <em>Si</em>, next week. <em>Papa</em> took my arm. “Look him in the eye and say you are a hard worker and a serious man, that you are going to America, but he has probably heard it, but say it anyway. He has been there and back, more than once, as I recall. He will understand what is in your mind. But watch him close, as he has a hatred for farmers not matched anywhere else in <em>Sicilia</em>. It was the beating he took, years ago.” <em>Papa</em> poured wine, lit his cigar, that would last him all day, and when he blew smoke into the air, he turned away from me. My lungs are bad from birth. “If he you are allowed see his daughter, that is one thing, but permission to court is like a proposal of marriage. Once you say it, you cannot take it back, or <em>Rao</em> will see it as an insult to his daughter, and there will be trouble between the families.” <em>Papa</em> gently punched my arm to rouse me. “You must respect this tradition…or walk away, now.” “If he says ‘no’, what do I do?” <em>Papa</em> stirred the wine with the tip of his cigar. I wanted him to say, “<em>Vaffanculo</em> to tradition,” but he did not “Then you lose,” he said. “You lose.” The old men say you must walk with two feet in one shoe. To go against her father is not impossible, but I already knew this to be true. “He knows by now you are coming, so do not wait, or he will think you a coward. He is waiting for you, now, as we sit here and have a nice drink…do not wait.”</p>
  <p>It was <em>Lunedi</em> (Monday), I had maybe, seven, eight hours of work repairing tools for <em>Signuri Mancini</em>, a landowner from <em>Napoli</em>, who come to inspect his farms, and take accounting of the profits. The air, even before high noon, was humid and wet, dripping, like the leaves drip after a good rain. Breathing was more a chore, than a pleasant thing, as breathing is supposed to be. The old <em>Sicilians</em> say, “The sun is so hot it cracks the rocks.” I worked for <em>Mancini’s</em> overseer, <em>Enrico Nattura</em>, a thug of a man, hated by anyone who worked for him, including me. But the <em>capu’s</em> loved him and paid him well, as he could squeeze the last drop of sweat from any man he hired. This morning he demanded I work in the sun, when there were shade trees all around. <em>Nattura’s</em> excuse, if he allowed me to work in the shade, the <em>capu</em> would show up and say he is soft on the workers. When I protested to <em>Nattura</em>, this thug that he was, he points to the road, and yelled furiously, like a madman, “these are my rules, take it or leave it.” <em>Nattura</em> had a high voice, and whether he talked low, or yelled, he seemed to be whining, like a woman. “If <em>Mancini</em> sees you fucking off…he will say I am fucking off. We will both be out.” Working for a <em>cavone</em> like <em>Mancini</em>, and his brigand, <em>Nattura</em>, I could see why <em>Carmela’s</em> father had a hatred for dirt farmers. All day <em>Nattura</em> worked me like a dog. “Bark,” he said, and I barked; but I see being a real dog is better, as <em>Nattura’s</em> three dogs sat in the shade, or wandered to the stream and lapped cool water, and shit whenever they wanted, wherever they wanted. Me? I ask to take a shit and he says “where, and how long will it take and what color will it be? And I allow no smoking when you shit, as smoking is not shitting.”</p>

  <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
  <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Confrontation in the Piazza</h3>
  <p>When work was done, and <em>Nattura</em> give me permission to leave, I thought of stopping in the <em>piazza</em> to see <em>Carmela’s</em> father, if he was there, if he was sober, but I decide I would give myself a few more days to get ready, because the words in my head were not right, but mixed up and confused. The way home was though the <em>piazza</em>, and I would be careful and avoid him if he was there. I take the longest trail to the <em>piazza</em>, past the <em>Chiesa di Sant’ Agata</em>, the most beautiful of the six churches in the village, but not the oldest. Its great oak door, over ten feet high, opened onto the <em>Piazza Del Poppolo</em>, the peoples square, but not square, only three sides, from where the village streets started or ended, however you see it. The cornerstone of the great church was laid sometime in the 15th century, but the church was not finished for a hundred years, between the <em>briganti</em>, three fires, two earthquakes and raiding armies. I owe <em>Patri Carmine</em> for this good information. “<em>Napoleon</em>, himself, sent two armies up the mountain to burn our Church, but it still stands because of the intervention of <em>Sant’Agata</em>, herself. Destroyed and rebuilt…a tribute to our faith in Christ’s goodness.” <em>Patri</em> said this in a sermon, and I was there and heard it, and attest the women were weeping and we all made the sign of the cross.</p>
  <p>As I come off the mountain trail, <em>Carmelo Iannuzzi</em> was lighting the last of the oil lamps, that cast orange across the <em>piazza</em>, making everything glow. Someone calls my name. I turned too quick toward the sound, losing my balance, and falling against a table where sat a solitary man. <em>Signuri Rao</em>, himself. Panic. I was not ready. Tomorrow, or the day after; maybe sometime this week. He looked me in the eye; my legs go weak, and it took all I had to stay on my feet. I meekly nod, like his inferior, and shit my pants when I looked on his cold stare. My stomach was boiling and the bile, or whatever it is, started up my throat and burned. I was sick and most times I would <em>puke</em>, throw up, but I was too scared. The best, I thought, was to give up, here, on the cobblestones, in front of everyone I knew. I took deep breaths and backed away from his table, as I felt with my feet for a way to escape. I say this, that ‘honorable’ did not matter to me, until I straightened up and saw too many men I knew, including the big mouths, <em>Andriatti</em>, <em>Mazzuli</em>, <em>Dominick Farnicci</em> and his crazy cousin, whose last name I forget. I stared at the back of <em>Rao’s</em> head as I cleared my throat, until he turned a little and I see his cheek and the side of his long and crooked nose, that was burned, almost black from the sun. I bow and scrape, like the fool I am. “<em>Scusa</em>, <em>Signuri Rao</em>, my name is <em>Antonino Sparacino</em>. <em>Mi dispiace</em>, I bumped your table, but…” He ignored me, and <em>Farnicci</em> and his brother, who watched, laughed like fools they were, and I knew one of them called me, for no reason but to make sure I confronted <em>Rao</em>. Everyone knew. What could I do?</p>
  <p><em>Signuri Rao</em> was fifty, maybe fifty-five, but time and the harsh sun had done him no favors, as his skin was rough, like the cement he poured and the stone he stacked. I coughed, but he still ignored me, while the two <em>cavones</em> laughed and giggled, like fools. I say it again, but louder and moved so I was easier to see. “<em>Signuri Rao</em>, I am <em>Antonino Sparacino</em>.” I removed my cap and bowed again, like a poor servant boy and I called to him again. “<em>Signuri Rao</em>,” and I waited for him to look me in the eye. “I wish to present myself, <em>Antonino Sparacino</em>.” He moved his right shoulder, some, or it was a twitch. “May I speak with you…about <em>Carmela</em>…your daughter?”</p>
  <p>He went into a fit, cursing and pounding the tabletop. “I know who <em>Carmela</em> is…am I a goddamned fool?” He slid his cup hard across the table, and it fell onto the stones, bouncing twice and resting in the bushes, out of his reach. Shit. Do I pick up the cup…maybe bring him another drink? He raised himself and turned to me and stared squarely at my face, and I admit fighting another urge to <em>vomito</em> (throw up), fearing I would seem a coward to the assoles who were watching from the nearby tables. “I know who you are,” he said, “What you want. <em>Che cazzo</em> (fuck)…leave me alone.” I had three, maybe four inches on him, but his body was wide and muscular, like a brawler; a well-built man for his age, and yes, I felt inferior to him. He coiled like a snake, and I believed he was ready to strike me, hard. His eyes shot bolts of fire from his green eyes. <em>Carmela</em> had green eyes. Through his stare, I felt hatred for me, like heat coming from his body. <em>Arturo Morelli</em> and <em>Enrico</em>, his son, took the next table, and <em>Rao</em> stares at them, maybe thinking they came with me, for some kind of support, but <em>Morelli</em> was only a peasant, like me, hardworking; a man who lived to mind his own business, But <em>Enrico</em>, his son, was lazy, not trustworthy; a drunk who drank for three men. What we say, everything, will be common talk in the village, by midday tomorrow, at least. “<em>Signuri Rao</em>. What I need to say is private, for you only” He spits on the ground, and I took this as a bad sign. “Alone? Why alone? Are you ashamed to talk in front of other men? Are you ashamed of yourself?” He took a few steps closer. “Answer me that.” “Ashamed? I have nothing to be ashamed about.” One of the <em>Morelli’s</em> laughed. I did not see his face, but it was <em>Enrico</em>, who laughs like a woman’s giggle. The goddamned fool that he is. “It is wrong to talk in front of the village,” I said. He stares at the <em>Morelli’s</em>, “the plague,” he said under his breath, then spit to the cobblestone. He wiped his mouth, then points to an empty table to the side of the bar. He went first and I followed.</p>

  <p>“What do you call yourself?” he asked. The air between us smelled of <em>grappa</em>, but he did not seem drunk, but close to drunk; he walked well, and made it to the table without falling, but stumbled once, maybe twice. “My father is <em>Orazio Sparacino</em>. <em>Papa</em> says you know him and worked with him.” He repeated “<em>Sparacino</em>?” shaking his head, and I was insulted by the look on his face. “Your father? His name is...?” “<em>Orazio Sparacino</em>. I just said it.” “Ah, <em>si</em>, so you did. <em>Orazio</em>.” He leaned and spit again. “Let me ask? Your father? He is a dirt farmer. <em>Si</em>? He works for that <em>cavone</em>, <em>Castello</em>. And your family?” “<em>Si</em>, he works for <em>Castello</em>. We all work for <em>Castello</em>…my whole family…if he has work. I guess we are all dirt farmers, like you say. What is wrong with that?” “You ask me ‘what is wrong with that?’ You are like a little child.” He leaned in and laughed. Any man would have said “fuck you” and took <em>Carmela</em> away. “What skill is there in turning dirt?” he asked, grinning like a fool. “Where is the skill?” “I have this good feeling when I see things grow.” “A good feeling? You throw a seed on the ground and if it rains it grows. What have you done to feel good? Where are the years of sweat to learn a trade?” He made motion of a man digging in the ground, and every eyeball in the piazza stared at him. “Shovel a little dirt, from here to there,” he said loud, like a drunk is loud, “Wait for rain and God does the rest. So, tell me, what have you done?” He leans to me. “Nothing,” he says, as he stuck his twisted finger in my face. “An ape can dig a hole. Some maybe better than you.” At this, the men in the piazza stopped what they were doing, drinking wine and talking, and starred at both of us, and <em>Rao</em> knew he had made a fool, but this did not cause him to leave. He sat and lowered his voice. “Tell me this, farmer, does your family own land, or are you a slave for other men?” “The land I work all belongs to <em>Sig. Castello</em>. It was his father’s land.” “<em>Castello</em>? I know him that <em>cavone</em>. Does he still cheat for pennies when he can?” “He says he pays what he owes.” The truth is he owes me two <em>lire</em> for years, but if I say it to <em>Rao</em>, he will think I am weak, a coward, for not demanding and getting what is due me.</p>

  <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Eruption and the Promise</h3>
  <p>I refused to wait on more insults, or would I give this <em>ubriaco</em> time for another drink. I was nervous, I trembled, and the bile burned my throat. “<em>Signuri Rao</em>. I want your permission to court <em>Carmela</em>.” He jumped from his seat and thrust his huge, closed first an inch from my face. “You want? Is that what you said? You want? A goddamned dirt farmer. What do you have…nothing…no future? I forbid you to see <em>Carmela</em>.” He pushed back against the table, knocking his chair to the floor and I see the rage and his hate for me that was overpowering. I hear <em>Papa’s</em> in my head. “Respectful. Be respectful, <em>sempre</em> (always).” “Stay away from my daughters,” he said, shaking his massive fist in my face. “Ignore them when you see them on the street,” he paused and looked across the piazza. “Or there will be hell to pay.” “<em>Signuri Rao</em>, please, let me talk.” “Say it fast, dirt farmer, you are on my time.” I shook, but I found the nerve to clear my throat and upright the chairs he tipped over, in his tantrum. “It is true what you say. I am a dirt farmer, as you call us. The land I work belongs to other men. But I have plans. And <em>Carmela</em>…” <em>Rao</em> stood, clenching his fist, not far from my face. “Stop….no more lies,” he said, cocking his arm and what I expected was a severe punch square to my face, but he did not. I recall asking myself, if he hits me do I run or fight? I saw the good, the bad in both. He leaned against the table, staring into my eyes; I fought hard not to look away. “You sonofabitch. You cornered my daughters in the shack, like they are nothing but <em>puttanu</em>. I should beat you here and now, in front of the whole town.” If he beats me, so be it. I will show good intentions and not fight back, as it would be disrespectful. “<em>Signuri</em>, it is not true. I did not corner your daughters, like you say. Our meeting was accidental and at all times innocent. I meant no disrespect to them.” I raised my right hand to God, swearing that what I said was true. “I sought shelter from a bad storm. I did not know she was in the hut, or <em>Giovanna</em>. Believe me, <em>Signuri</em>, I am a man of honor.” I look around the piazza; a few men nodded, that they agreed with me. I was a man of honor. “Ask anyone here.” He took his <em>grappa</em> cup, that was empty, and wiped the inside with a filthy bar rag that lay on the table. He poured a drink for himself, then one for me and pushed the cup across the table. I refused it. “No, <em>grazie</em>, I have not eaten yet. My stomach…” “That’s what I though. Weak stomach, weak man, and you must know I have no use for a weak man.” He dumped the <em>grappa</em> he had offered me, and I watch it splash on the cobblestones, then he drank straight from the bottle, tossing the empty carcass in the bushes, and it must have hit a rock because it broke into a thousand pieces. He snapped at the waiter, <em>Velocci’s</em> son. “Bring me another bottle and a goddamned clean cup.”</p>
  <p>He tapped and starred while he waited for the lazy waiter. “You were disrespectful to my daughters. I know it.” “No <em>Signuri</em>. I have never been disrespectful to any woman. I have sisters.” Only by an accident of nature could this bastard be <em>Carmela’s</em> father. Her mother, his wife (I do not know the woman) must be some fool to give this accident a place to happen. Of all the places in this world, of course <em>Rao</em> was born in my back yard; the gods would not have allowed less. This old bastard knows the truth, because his daughters have told him the truth, and the truth is innocent, but everything is evil to these old <em>Sicilianu</em>. “<em>Signuri Rao</em>, <em>Giovanna</em> was there. What does she say?” He waved his hand in my face. “<em>Giovanna</em>? She said it was innocent, but she is a good girl. She would lie to save her sister, and I would have it no other way. I know you kicked in the door, like a crazy man, scaring the both of them half to death. For this alone, I should kill you.” He pounded hard on the table. “So do not lie to me.” “You have said I kicked in the door to get at your daughters, but I did not. The shack is old and poorly built. When I pulled the door, it fell off the hinges in front of me.” “Poorly built? Is that what you said?” “<em>Si</em>. Yes, poor quality. The rain, it was leaking through the roof, the walls, and…” He leaned at me, so far off the chair he lost his balance. “I built that shack, me,” he pounded his chest, “and you…dirt farmer…say it was poorly made.” “Well, uh, <em>signuri</em>, then the owner did not keep the shack in good repair. This must be true. And the leaking walls, well, the ground has shifted. Anyone can see…” His voice shook. No more of your bullshit. What does a dirt farmer know about skill and hard work?” He was at that place where all men like him want to be, drunk and angry. The <em>grappa</em> has taken over his mind; he stared, his eyes like glass balls, as he moved his head, back and forth, maybe to see me better. “You waited…you followed them. Was it in your plan to touch her? To touch both of my daughters?” “No. Never, and I will swear it in front of the priest.” “Before the priest? Bullshit.” He struggled with the cork on the fresh bottle. “Better you swear before the devil, than some goddamned priest.” In case it was not clear to Him, I spoke direct to God, saying what was just said came from <em>Signuri Paolo Rao</em>, of this town, and not me, <em>Antonino Sparacino</em>; that I was man of the Catholic faith, and not a blasphemous man, disrespectful to the Church or any of its priests.</p>
  <p><em>Rao</em> turned from me and stared at a gentle looking, older woman, who was walking down the path from the overlook. She was familiar to me, but I could not remember her name. Old people look the same alike when you are young. “<em>Buonasera</em>, <em>signura</em>,” I said, as I tipped my cap, grateful for a break from this old man. She smiled and seemed ready to talk; he was nervous and looked away. She asked me, was the weather to my liking, though it was too hot to suit her, but she knew some men liked the steaming hot. She looked at <em>Rao</em>, and smiled and her eyes opened wide, like she had found a long-lost friend. “Oh, my God, it’s you, <em>Paolo</em>.” She stopped and smiled. “It has been a long time. How have you been?” He coughed and set his <em>grappa</em> down and straightened his jacket. “<em>Victoria</em>, it is you.” He seemed startled, like she was a ghost and not really there, but he coughed and wiped his forehead with his bare hand. No rag. “It’s been a long time,” he said, clearing his throat. “I have been better…but thank you for asking, <em>Victoria</em>.” I offered her my seat, and she thanked me and sat down, shoulder to shoulder with <em>Signuri Rao</em>, but she did not seem to be uncomfortable, or did he. Very strange, the both of them, together, in front of me. It was not my business how they knew each other, but I wondered why any woman would be happy to see such a vile man. They talked about the old days, like I was not there, that they had not seen each other since she moved to <em>Napoli</em>, but now she was back for a time to help her ailing daughter but would soon go home. They talked a long time, smiling when the “old days” and “better times” were mentioned, and one time she brushed her hand against his knee, but said she was sorry. By the end he seemed to loosen up, almost human. She wanted to stay longer, she said, but her grandchildren were waiting, and they needed her. She smiled. “Are you often in the <em>Piazza</em>?” “Every day at this time if I am working close.” “It was good to see you, <em>Paolo</em>. After all the years.” She apologized to me for the time she took. “<em>Paolo</em>, is this your son? We have not been introduced.” He cleared his throat. “No, not my son…a friend.” She smiled, put her hand on my arm. “<em>Paolo</em> is a good man,” she said. “I knew him many years ago.” I nod. “<em>Buonasera</em>,” she said to the both of us, and started walking toward <em>Via Parma</em>, where her daughter lived and her grandchildren. <em>Rao</em> watched her leave, saying not a word, but I see this longing in his eyes and wondered, was it any of my business? He watched until she turned the corner and disappeared, and he slumped into his chair. He lit his <em>stogie</em> and for a time he stared at the flame, until he doused it between his fingers. <em>Signora Marficci</em>, I believe that is her name. <em>Si</em>, <em>Marficci</em>. I waited until she was out of sight. Who was I to ruin this old man’s memories, whatever they were? Good or bad. She was gone, and for a moment he hung his head, then stared off into the hills. Memories, I guessed. I cleared my throat.</p>
  <p>“As I said, <em>Signuri Rao</em>, I am going to America and soon.” He stretched his neck and gazed across the <em>piazza</em>, and I figured he meant to take a last look, but she was gone. I never asked after her, who she was, or why she upset him; was she was anything more than an old acquaintance, or maybe a family friend. It was not my business, but his manner changed. He coughed and spit onto the stones. “You were saying, dirt farmer?” I clear my throat. “I want to buy my own land when I come back from America. Like <em>Andrea DeMatteo</em> did. You know him?” <em>Rao</em> laughs and coughs and tossed his cigar to the ground. “<em>Si</em>. I know him. The fool. And what land did he buy? He bought a pile of rocks in <em>Fiumedinisi</em>. He’s the same fool as his father…two fools. Is that your ambition?” I ignored his insult, but again I asked for permission to see his daughter. He had lit a new cigar, and I watch the smoke curl around his head; of course, the breezes pushed the smoke my way, and I could not avoid it and I coughed like a fool. A waste of life, to suck smoke into your lungs from these foul cigars. “The smoke bothers you?” he asked. “No, not at all, <em>signuri</em>. Something was caught in my throat. I meant no…” “America, heh?” He slowly shook his head, and grinned and I hated the look on his face. “And what if you decide not to come back? Maybe you will find some <em>puttanu</em> who gives it up, like no decent woman would do. Maybe she has a husband, and he puts a knife in your ribs, and you are dead after that. Who will know? Or you like it better there than here. What then? You will have made a fool of my daughter before the whole town.” He dropped his <em>stogy</em> onto the cobblestone, crushing it with the heal of his boot. “I have been to America…twice.” He thinks. “No…three times. The years I wasted chasing this dream of a better life. Ten, fifteen, maybe? You know what I found, dirt farmer?” He looks me square in the eye. “Do you know what I found?” I looked, I stared, but said nothing. “There is no better life,” he says. “A better life is a dream. That is why men like me call men like you dreamers. I was a dreamer, once, but I am a dreamer no more.” Then he did a strange thing for which I cannot account; he put his arm around my shoulder and pulled me close. I tried to escape his hold, but his arm, too hard; he was an oak, and I was embarrassed by his power over me. We faced each other inches apart. “Two men went with me on the second trip to America.” He shakes his finger in my face and I step back from him. “Neither came back. One found a new wife, younger and prettier than the one he left behind. ‘How can I leave her here or bring her here?’ he asked me a hundred times a day. He was happy there, but his wife was sad, and his children were sad, and one swore to kill his father if he ever saw him again. He never did. No one ever does. <em>Si</em>. Here he had a wife and two children. They are still here, and he is not. He is out there.” He points toward the sea. “And now there are grandchildren here, and maybe there.” I asked, “who is this man.” But he ignored me, and tightened his grip on my arm, that was already numb. “The other disappeared. Never came home one day.” He stared across the piazza. “We worked in <em>Cheecago</em>, in America, cutting meat twelve hours a day, living in a rat hole with six other men, all <em>Calabrese</em>, except me, and all ignorant. One night he never came back from work. They found him, but his body was in the stockyards, dead, of course; his pay and poke, gone. His throat cut,” and <em>Rao</em> takes his finger and runs it from ear to ear, with a smile on his weathered face. “They blamed colored men. The cops said they were all animals.” I coughed to clear my throat. “These things will not happen to me,” but he laughed. “That’s what he said, ‘it will not happen to me.’ Now I barely remember his name. <em>Tornato</em>, I think. <em>Gino</em>. We met in Naples, on the docks and he asked if he could come along, as he did not want to travel alone. A good man, innocent and hard working. <em>Si</em>. That was his name, <em>Gino Tornato</em>.” He fumbled around the pockets of his coat. “Do you have a cigar?” “Sorry, <em>Signori Rao</em>, I do not smoke.” “<em>Si</em>, that’s right…<em>scusa</em>. The smoke makes you sick. What was I saying? <em>Si</em>, my daughter <em>Carmela</em>, she could choose any man in this town, in any town in <em>Sicilia</em>. But she says she has chosen you. This I do not understand…my <em>Carmela</em> with a dirt farmer.” He shook his head, regretfully, I admit. “What a beautiful girl.” He pauses. “But you have guts, farmer. It helps you with me, but only a little. <em>Poco</em>.” He staggers to the edge of the piazza, and leans over the short wall, holding his bottle, sighing long and deep. I wanted to believe he was thinking of the past, maybe some great regret. Maybe the woman he talked with; they were close, years ago. I wanted to believe <em>Carmela’s</em> father was human, with a heart and a feeling. Maybe he is stalling, hoping I will tire and go home. He looks me in the eyes. “I believe her, what she said. I do not like you, farmer, but she does. So,” he stops and stared across the overlook, “I will regret this…but I will give you permission to visit my daughter.” His finger pointed at my eye. “But only Sunday, and if are invited. And I warn you of this, dirt farmer. You come clean and dry…no mud or shit on your boots, or wine on your breath.” He took my arm, pulling me down to his eye level. “And do not come smelling like a barn animal. I warn you. And listen to me. I will not say it again. I give you two years and no more. Go to America, if you must, and make your fortune” He laughs. “When you return…if you return…you will do what is honorable. She will be near eighteen years old, and overdue for marriage. Do there what you cannot do here. Get it out of your system. But I warn you,” he says, poking his finger in my chest, “If in two years you do not do what is right…,” he paused, released his grip and I stood straight up, “you will never see her again. This is my promise to you. <em>Capisci</em>? Do you understand?” “<em>Si</em>, yes, I do, <em>signuri Rao</em>. I appreciate…” He brought a half-empty <em>grappa</em> bottle to his crooked nose and sniffed. “A sweet smell,” he said. “This is all I will miss when I am dead…maybe my daughters if they marry right.” He finished the bottle, not stopping for a breath of air. I wanted to beat him senseless, but I believe in this way he was my better.</p>

  <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Sunday Walk and the Final Vow</h3>
  <p>For months after that day, I passed Sundays with the <em>Rao</em> family, except Sundays I had work and I could not miss work, even a few hours of work. Thank God <em>Rao</em> was never there, and that he was always somewhere else made for a pleasant Sunday dinner. <em>Rao</em> was no rich man, but his family was better off than most, and the meals were good quality food, and a good table was always set. The best of Sunday after dinner, when I was usually given permission to walk and talk with <em>Carmela</em> for an hour, her mother, a pleasant women, always our chaperone. The walk was tradition, and it helped us know each other better. To be alone before marriage was unthinkable without the supervision of family. We would talk about our plans for America and what we wanted. <em>Carmela</em> was a good woman, for a young girl; she cared about what I had to say, always listening carefully, offering an opinion only when asked, and then only a few words. It was the third Sunday of the second month, and I remember this day like yesterday, because <em>Carmela’s</em> mother was sick and she sent, instead, her <em>cognata</em> (sister-in-law), <em>Zia Agata Rao</em>, to protect the lamb from the lion. I was the lion. It was hell hot that Sunday, the air so thick and wet, to breathe was a chore, and it being too humid to walk the steep trail, we wandered through the piazza. Poor <em>Zia</em> did her best, but her old legs were thin and weak, and she protested the pain, while barking orders, like an overseer. “Keep your distance…not too close.” We feared her, in a way, as her power as chaperone was great, like a cop, maybe a <em>Carabinieri</em>. She could not keep up in the heat, as all the walking she did those days, was to the privy in the back of the house, near the woods. She was always doing the <em>scoreggia</em> (farts) as she walked. Nat every step, but a good number. <em>Carmella</em> blamed this ailment on <em>zia’s</em> age, and the rich food she ate, not like peasant food my mother had to serve. We laughed when she did the <em>scoreggia</em>, not that she did it, but for the excuses that she made. “Did you hear it…a noise. What was it?” and she looked, innocently, behind herself, up and down the road, in the trees, as if someone else was doing the <em>scoreggia</em>, not her. Of course, we did the honorable thing, turning away when we laughed, out of respect, but I am certain she was heard a mile away (sound travels far in the mountains). Who will say they do not laugh at the <em>scoreggia</em>? An honest man will admit it. “What ails you two, <em>Carmela</em>?” she asked when we laughed. “Nothing, <em>Zia</em>. <em>Antonino</em> told a joke. That’s all.” “Never mind jokes, three feet between you,” was her answer, and waving her bonnet in the air, the string wrapped around her crooked finger. We both enjoyed the laughing, but the best was the touching when we could. Is it wicked to touch when you are not married? We did though, and I admit it, but it was always planned. We watched for a patch of rough cobblestone, and together fake a misstep, falling slightly against each other, then pushing away, after <em>mi scusi</em>, <em>mi dispiace</em> (excuse me, I am sorry). Wicked. We will burn in hell, but <em>Zia</em> was old, and never the wiser; easily fooled, not like <em>Carmela’s</em> mother who was always a cop. <em>Zia’s</em> skill was her ability to argue and taunt, at everything else she failed. She was small and frail, with the nature of a wounded bear. A widow, of sorts, they say her man died in some war, the name and place of this war was never mentioned. She lived off the charity of her brother <em>Paolo Rao</em>, who treated her like the queen, to the disappointment of his wife, who thought the seat next to the king was rightly her place, and not the sister-in-law. The truth, I learned, <em>zia’s</em> husband left after five years of marriage, escaping to some village near <em>Napoli</em>. He was rarely mentioned, and never his name, except to carry on the legend that they loved each other, and he was a hero, not just another conscript murdered in some war, but that he died valiantly, saving many comrades. Some years after his “heroic” death, one of the village men, <em>Giovanni Panaleone</em>, saw him on a street in <em>Napoli</em>, manacled between two <em>Carabinieri</em>, alive and well, struggling to free himself, and certainly no hero. <em>Zia</em> was barren and they say it is the reason he did not stay with her. <em>Carmela</em> and <em>Giovanna</em> were her children, and they followed her orders without question, as <em>Signuri Rao</em> enforced his sisters place in the family.</p>
  <p>I tripped on a raised cobblestone. “Be careful, you fool,” <em>Zia</em> yells to me, and I cower lest we would be discovered. “You will hurt <em>Carmela</em>. Why are you so clumsy?” “<em>Scusa</em>,” I said. “The street is broken up and I am tired. It will not happen again.” At the next step I started to close the distance with <em>Carmela</em>, setting up a stumble for the next street. We strolled through the village, the old lady screaming orders, and herding us down the path like two beasts to the coral. This Sunday I speak of we walked from <em>Via Spiritu Sanctu</em>, through the <em>Piazza Del Poppolo</em>, past the <em>Chiesa di Santa Agata</em>, and by then poor <em>zia</em> was out of breath and coughing. “I need to rest,” she said, lowering herself to the ground under a wide chestnut tree. <em>Zia</em> complained, poor woman, on the heat and the cobblestones, how they ruined her legs. She spoke to the Lord while fanning her face and neck. “<em>Mio Diu</em>…why do you make me suffer. My poor legs are cramped and on fire.” Black stockings rolled to her ankles; her hair, cut like a man, and she made no effort to look like a woman, if she ever did. She cried, tears dripping onto the worn bodice of the only dress she owned. “<em>Carmela</em>, how far will you walk today? The heat is killing me. But who cares about an old woman? Leave me here to die. No one cares about an old woman.” <em>Carmela</em> knelt beside her aunt, who was out of breath, and wiped sweat from her forehead and neck. “<em>Antonino</em> is no dreamer, and you should worry more about the heat, or it will kill you.” This headstrong woman, not easily silenced, pushed <em>Carmela</em> hand away. “My cousin’s son, <em>Pietro</em>, with two cousins from his mother’s side, went to America a long time ago. They jailed <em>Pietro</em> because he was <em>Siclianu</em>…for no other reason. When they let him go, he left America and came home a broken man, dragging his tail and in the end, he had nothing. His brother, <em>Giovanni</em>, stayed, but he writes to the priest, only now and then. <em>Alfredo</em>, the best of them was a saint (she makes the sign of the cross); I knew him well, but he disappeared in America. They said America is <em>grande</em>, bigger than <em>Sicilia</em> and <em>Italia</em> put together…I do not know…I have not been there. The priest believes he is dead, so for that reason I pray for his soul.” She stopped talking and looked around us. “We have come far enough…it is time to go home.” <em>Carmela</em> pleaded. “But we are not done with our walk. And <em>Antonino</em> is no dreamer. You should be ashamed for saying it.” The angry old woman grabbed <em>Carmela</em> by the arm. “You will not talk to me that way. I will tell you father.” I was right, <em>Carmela</em> was a fighter, and she could not let it go; her finger was in <em>zia’s</em> face, like the barrel of a pistol. “Your husband left you…you are…” She stopped and covered her mouth; a wise thing that she did not finish the sentence. <em>Zia</em> struggled to get up from the ground, but fell back and moaned, “Put your finger away…you…you disrespectful girl.” “Please, <em>Zia</em>, we have so much to say. He is leaving soon.” “I cannot fight you and this heat…talk…go ahead and talk. Leave me against this tree, like a homeless beggar. Give me a cup. I will stay here and maybe collect a few coins from passerby’s who might respect old age and wisdom, like you do not.” “You are not homeless. <em>Papa</em> takes care of you, and we will find a place for you to rest.” Like a fool, I tried to calm <em>Zia</em> down. “Do whatever you think is right to ease your conscious,” she said, and waved me away. <em>Carmela</em> asked for my help, and I lifted <em>Zia</em> to her feet; she was slight and weak and went limp, like a doll. I walked her to an empty bench in the overlook, well shaded, out of the sun, and aired by a strong sea breeze. Water? Did we have water? She wanted cool water. I had no glass or cup, so I bring water from the fountain in my cupped hands. She drank it and asked for more; this time splashing what I brough in her face, saying how good it felt, so cool. She lay her head against the back of the bench and told us to leave her; before we get ten feet her head dropped forward and she was asleep, or worse, so I watch, to make sure she was breathing. She looked rested and peaceful, as though she had passed, but corpses do not wheeze, mumble, and fart, that she did while I watched.</p>
  <p>We picked on the smallest bench in the <em>piazza</em>, so small we were forced to sit close and touch, and for a time we listened to the sounds around us, the words of the wind, and watched the people. I remember thinking, if life was never more complicated than this moment, I would stay there forever, to hell America. <em>Signuri Carricio</em> and his wife, <em>Assunta Mariani</em>, took the bench a few feet away. <em>Signura Mariani</em> saw <em>Zia</em> asleep and smiled, saying to <em>Carmela</em> she hoped we would have a pleasant talk and a good walk. I take <em>Carmela</em> by the hand, and we strolled from the overlook, down the twisted path along the wall. We stopped under an old elm, away from the ears and eyes that followed us wherever we went. “Mama and <em>Papa</em> talk about you,” she said, brushing her dress smooth. I looked back and <em>zia</em> was snoring like farm help from <em>Calabria</em>. “What do they say?” “That you are a dreamer. And <em>Zia</em> agrees with him. <em>Mama</em> likes you, but I am sorry to say what she thinks does not count much with <em>papa</em>.” She brushed my hand with her hip; our first real touch, as I do not include the fakery on the cobblestones. She apologized, as if she had done me some injury, or she was a stranger who bumped me in a crowd. Rub against me again, if you want, all you want. She fidgeted with the sleeves of her dress and would not look me in the eye. “<em>Papa</em> says you will fail. You are a dreamer. No peasant will ever own land in this town.” “Your father says I am a dreamer. What do you think?” “I did not understand what <em>papa</em> said. Is it against the law that you own land?” “No. Not against the law.” She looked at me, confused. Who is right? Me or her father? “But the law will never protect us,” I said. “We are peasants…<em>contidini</em>.” She stared at me, squinting her green eyes. “I do not understand it…what you said.” Should I take her hands in this horrible heat, as I sweated like a like a nervous hog. Does she see the sweat run down my face? When she turned to check <em>Zia</em> on the bench, I wiped my palms on the sleeve of my shirt. <em>Carmela</em> touched my arm, and my heart beat hard. “I want to say something to you, <em>Antonino</em>.” <em>Zia</em> coughed and stirred on the bench. Sleep, old woman, or I will hit you with a rock. “If life is better in America,” she paused. I stared at her beautiful face, olive skin, and large green eyes. “Then you should stay there…call for me and I will join you. That seems the best to do. I know <em>Sicilia</em> is dying. I see it. <em>Papa</em> sees it but will not say it. He loves this place no matter.” “Dying? <em>Carmela</em>? Did you say <em>Sicilia</em> is dying?” What does a woman know about these things? It is for men to say if our country is dying. Is it a woman business? Women should worry about her husband and her children and her home. She was quiet. deep into her own thoughts. “I have been thinking about these things, you and me and our future together.” She stops and looks at me. “We do have a future together. This is what you have been trying to say, I think.” I swear to God I could not breath. And I did it, I admit, and will say it in front of the whole village and the priest. I took her hand and kissed it, but barely, not hard. She pulled away and together we looked off away from each other. “I am sorry, it will never happen again,” I said as honest as I could say it. She laughed and took a step closer to me. “Never? I hope you are not right.” She smiled and I understood what she meant, and I was embarrassed. “You go to America. I will wait for you. When the time is right you will come back and will buy a little land, or if it is better there, I will go back with you. Or write to the priest and I will come, wherever you are.” “Leave your family. Your sister? Your home?” “If you think it is best for us.” “But I have told everyone I will come back and buy land. I told your father.” “You said what you had to say. What is here? I see it. All the best leave, and the best of the best never return.”</p>
  <p>On that Sunday afternoon, everything was settled. The sun was falling toward <em>Palermu</em>, and <em>Carmela</em> could not look away. It was time to go. She shook her head. “Please, let’s stay a few more minutes. For the sun to set; at least until it hits the sea.” “But your family? They will wonder. I do not want to battle with your father.” She pointed to the fire red setting sun and asked me, “Where does it go when it leaves?” “Somewhere else, I guess.” “Of course, somewhere else. I know that. But where? Do you know?” I loved the cut of her young body against the setting sun, and I thought sinful things, but my respect for her and the fear of hell for all eternity, kept me a gentleman (and her father’s iron fists played no little part). She took my hand, “<em>Antonino</em>, do you ever think silly thoughts?” I thought. Did I ever? What man would admit having silly thoughts? But, when I was a child, my grandfather, my mother’s father, told me a story about a man held prisoner in the moon, for a thousand years, at least. A young man from <em>Calabria</em>, who had disgraced his family for a reason no one remembered, and some god, not our God, banished him to the moon. “Look hard,” <em>nonno</em> would say, and she took my hand and pointed it to the full moon. “See his face?” I did, and thereafter, on clear nights, when I saw him up there, I wondered if he suffered? I was only a child. Six, or maybe seven. What was I to think? I realized when I was a man, it was my grandfather’s way of saying never to disgrace the family. To this day I see his face on the moon and laugh and wonder how he is getting along. “No. I have never had a silly thought.” This was my first lie to <em>Carmela</em>. And my second lie, “I have always been a serious man.” And my third lie, “I will never tell you a lie.” “My strong man,” she grinned, pulling her hand away, “I do not believe a word of it. Dreams do not make you a woman, <em>Antonino</em>. But I think it is time to go.” <em>Zia</em> was sleeping peacefully. The fine dirt from the <em>Piazza</em> floor, whipped by the ocean breeze, settled on her face and occasionally she flicked at herself, like a horse swatting flies with its tail. Sooner or later, she would wake and herd us home. I offered <em>Carmela</em> my hand; she took it, smiled, then pulled away, and took it again. This time I held her so tight she could barely move, and she complained, but smiled. I leaned to her and in a gentle voice I said, “We will always be together, tight, like our hands are joined together.” My God, am I more a woman than <em>Carmela</em>? She said my name softly; her beautiful green eyes filled with tears. “<em>Antonino</em>, I think we…” <em>Zia</em> stirred on the bench, waking, groggy and mean, roaring like an angry farm boss; <em>Carmela</em> was too slow, what she wanted to say would stay unsaid, until a better time. “What time is it?” <em>Zia</em> yelled. “<em>Carmela</em>, what time is it…we must leave. <em>Andiamo</em>. Your father will send the <em>Carabinieri</em> for us.” She groaned as she worked herself off the bench. Pains in her back, she said, her hips and her legs; her head felt like a thousand fires roared inside. She looked to the sky where her God lived. “Why do You ignore my suffering?” She smoothed her rumpled dress, pulled at the <em>kerchief</em> that had slipped over her eye; a sight she was to see, as if she had fallen there, drunk. My best day was coming to an end. “<em>Carmela</em>, your mother said an hour…an hour at most. How long has it been?” <em>Zia</em> was still struggling to lift herself off the bench. “How long was I…? You should not have let me sleep...you did this to me, you foolish child.” I grabbed her by the arm, lifting her off the bench. She brushed her dress, and straightened the <em>kerchief</em> on her head, while complaining she was a failure as a chaperone, and uttering curses no woman should know. She put her finger in <em>Carmela’s</em> face. “Leaving you two to your own. What a fool I must be…<em>andiamo</em>,” and she started down the path, but the wrong way. I took her hand and righted her way. <em>Zia</em> had failed in her appointment, as it was her sworn duty to see we did not talk about the wrong things, or walk too close, or, may God forgive us, touch. We did all three, many times. It was a wicked, but pleasant afternoon, and if there is blame, it will be on <em>Zia</em>. Thank God. We took our time walking back to the village, <em>Zia</em> between us. Every ten steps, “no talking,” she would say, like a drill master. It was dusk when we reached <em>Via Spiritu Sanctu</em>, and the dinner mess had been cleaned up; the table was back in the shed and the chairs had disappeared. <em>Carmela’s</em> mother, <em>Signora Fiumara</em>, was working her broom across the stoop, sweeping scraps into the street. Wasted dogs and other vermin roamed the town, like four legged, wingless vultures. I hate them, but they picked the streets clean, eating each other if needed and that was good. “All part of God’s plan,” <em>Patri Carmine</em> said many times.</p>
  <p><em>Carmela’s</em> mother was a small, petite woman, in her fifties, and sickly most always, then her work fell on <em>Carmela</em> and <em>Giovanna</em>, and, like good, respectful daughters, they never complained, and the small house (better than a shack) was always neat and clean. <em>Rao</em> built the house with stone he cut, free, from the mountains, on a small piece of land he won in a card game, that some say was rigged and dishonest. <em>Rao’s</em> only complaint on the property, it was too small for grape vines, therefore free wine. What do I know? The sisters were sisters, but close like good friends. Behind the house, in the shallow stream, they washed clothes and cleaned plates and spoons (and themselves). In the daytime they worked with the father, tending the old mule, gathering stone, then home to cook and clean. This was life until married, and then the struggle would be longer and harder, but in a different home, and with three or four of their own children, if they survived the first birth. I saw this in my mother, and I see it in <em>Carmela’s</em> mother. In <em>Sicilia</em> the women die young, and every family in my village has lost a woman, or more, to childbirth, or some other disease brought on by its toil. If I take <em>Carmela</em> to America, she will live and be happy, and no longer be part of this slow and painful death, that is our tradition. I hear from men who have returned that American woman are lazy and spoiled and live forever, because they refuse to work, and they are and are <em>grassa</em> (fat) from eating candy all day.</p>
  <p><em>Carmela’s</em> mother saw us coming down the path and stopped working and leaned on her broom. “You are late,” she said. “Lucky <em>Paolo</em> is not home.” <em>Giovanna</em> stood close to her mother, smiling like a cat. “It is nothing,” <em>Zia</em> said, not looking her <em>cognata</em> in the eyes. “We stopped to watch the sea. Such a beautiful afternoon I lost track of the time. It is nothing. These two were well chaperoned and well behaved, is that not right <em>Carmela</em>?” I ached…ached to tell the truth. Ached. <em>Carmela</em>, for what reason, backed up <em>Zia</em>, by telling a fine lie. “She was an overseer, <em>mama</em>. We begged her to stop walking and let us watch the sea; she said only a minute and no more.” <em>Zia</em> smiled. Her confidence in her position was back. “Where is my brother?” she asked, as she checked the deserted street. “Is there bread left?” No. No bread, and very little food. “What am I to eat? Keeping both eyes on these two has drained me. I need food.” “You ate,” <em>Signora Fiumara</em> replied. “Before you left. Did you forget?” <em>Zia</em> nodded and wiped her forehead. “This heat. <em>Mio Diu</em>, the heat, even at night. It takes so much out of me.” She lowered herself onto the stoop and rubbed her ankles. “My feet. <em>Mio Diu</em>, the pain.” <em>Giovanna</em>, the sister, smiled. “You are so late. Did something happen?” <em>Zia</em> gave her a dirty look, then reached up from the steps, grabbing <em>Giovanna</em> by the arm, “Mind your business, and help me in the house. <em>Mio Diu</em>, the pain.” <em>Giovanna</em> smiled. “<em>Ci vediamo</em>, <em>Antonino</em>. “See you next Sunday.” “<em>Si</em>. <em>Ci vediamo domenica prossima</em>.” <em>Giovanna</em> and <em>signora Rao</em> disappeared into the house, and even through the thick door, I could hear <em>Zia</em> complain about her hips, her feet and Sicilian men who dream too much. I removed my cap, out of respect. “<em>Signora Fiumara</em>, thank you for the fine meal.” “You are welcome, <em>Antonino</em>. You will come next Sunday?” “Next Sunday? If I am welcome, <em>signora</em>. Of course, I will be here.” I bid goodbye to her mother, asking her to give my respects to <em>Sig. Rao</em>, as I was sorry to have missed him (my third or fourth lie in as many hours). <em>Carmela</em> stood in the doorway, her hand resting on her mother’s shoulder. “Please give my respects to <em>Sig. Rao</em>,” I said again. “If only I could thank him myself.” “He is some somewhere in the neighborhood, visiting,” she said. Drinking, playing cards, she meant. “He will be sorry he missed you.” Her first lie. Up close I see a red mark on her cheek, but maybe she fell, and what I saw was not the mark of a good beating, but maybe a slap. It was not my business. Maybe it was not a good day for her. For me, it was the best Sunday.</p>
