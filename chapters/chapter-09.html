        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">Fighting for a Place in Line</h3>

        <p><em>Santo</em> said he would pray for good weather, but by God, or luck, we had moonlight, but no place to sleep, and in the morning, we fight for a place in line, against men who have planned better and are rested. The losers, maybe us, will pound salt as they wait for the next ferry, if another is allowed; or stare, like jealous old women, as the winners sail away. Desperate men, I know from experience, will pay ten, twenty times the value of a ticket for a place on this ferry. I was in <em>Messina</em> my last post before they discharged me from the army. I guarded the goddamned docks, that takes no more brains than a morning shit. But it was easy duty and I owe it all to good conduct and treating men in authority respectfully. I owe this to a father who ruled his house, in a way good men are supposed to rule. I was no misfit, like <em>Luca</em>, who is too much a proud man, always going his own way, as he sees this as what he is, a free man. For me, I learn the rules I was given to live by, and obey these rules, and life is easier, unless you have been born with some fatal disease, or drink bad water at an early age. <em>Salute</em>. Show respect to all superiors, no matter how you are treated, as treating other men bad is their privilege, and some say a sign of good leadership. Button your mouth shut and learn what they have to teach; in the army it being how to load a rifle and shoot a rifle, but thank God, I never faced the enemy, if there was an enemy, and this made my training useless, except it made the officers feel needed. I do not recall there being an enemy, or anyone called “the enemy,” but in any case, I was not trained to recognize the enemy, as my superiors did it for me. I never killed for them, thank God, but I believe in my heart I would if I was told to, but to save my life, not for medals, or furloughs, or a pat on the back, that means nothing. <em>Papa</em> says we kill, not because we are brave, but that we are afraid not to kill when told it was the right thing. If I killed for them, and there was no good reason to kill, only that they were the enemy, I believe it was Gods duty to see I rotted in hell. “Kill a man, even a woman or a child, if you must to save your life” this old priest says when we were trained, “Or if told to do so by a superior. Never worry, God will forgive you because you were following orders.” One of those old soldiers, always drunk and falling down, one night put his finger in my face and said, very calmly, “you are not a man until you gut another man, with a rusty bayonet.” He laughed and the men around us laughed. The thought of it still gives me sweats, though it was many years ago. I should be thinking about the ferry. I am wandering.</p>

        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">Across the Straits, Not the Sea</h3>

        <p>I recall three, four boats a day went to <em>Calabria</em> and one to <em>Napoli</em>, but the ferry to <em>Napoli</em> was a relic, a castoff from the Italian Navy, likely to sink in the open sea at some time, but I have not heard of it happening. Every boat leaving <em>Messina</em> was loaded with <em>Siciliani</em> fleeing (I say ‘fleeing,’ not ‘leaving’) to some place or another. I figured the boat to <em>Napoli</em>, dilapidated as it was, best fit our plan as it cut out the long train ride from <em>Villa San Giovanni</em>, in <em>Calabria</em>. <em>Santo</em> vetoed this right off, admitting he feared crossing the open sea on a ‘raft,’ as he called it, though he had never been on a raft, or seen a ferry, only hearing drunk talk in the <em>Piazza del Poppolo</em>, from men who said they were on it, and lucky to be alive. What did <em>Santo</em> know? He has not been out of his own way or had both feet off the ground at the same time, except to sleep. But to calm his fears we agreed to the long way, across the Straits of <em>Messina</em> to <em>Villa San Giovanni</em> and the train to <em>Napoli</em>, not the simple ride across the <em>Tyrrhenian Sea</em>. America. We are going to America. I like to say it and hear the sound of it. America.</p>

        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">The Call to Quit</h3>

        <p>We walked on to <em>Messina</em>, riot, or no. My feet and my legs were sore and aching, but I went on, and in hours we saw the small signs we were nearing a city, and this gave me hope and some relief from the pain. The trees were not as tall and full, as we were walking away from the great forest, and the hills flattened out to the sea. The air was thinner now and did not smell so much of fish. I believe the wind changes near <em>Messina</em>, and the fish smell stays out at sea. I see the flickering lights ahead, below the horizon line, and this meant life. Then it hit me and I was dizzy from it, the thought that I was going to America, some alien world, where I have not been invited, and who says they will let me in, or if they do, they would not let me stay loo long, or I will get in, but hate it worse than bad pain, then what do I do?</p>
        <p>“Forget the foolishness…go home,” a voice in my ear said it clearly, and I turn to the others and asked if they heard the same voice. They did not, or they did and would not admit it, as most believe only the crazy hear voices. I am not crazy, but I heard these voices all the time.</p>
        <p>The old man on the mule. I admit his story of riots and murder undid me some, as did <em>Gennaro Fiorini</em>, the fisherman back on the beach, and it is worse since the sun has dropped behind the mountain. I hate the night. I fear it. Whosoever says he is not afraid of the night, is a deceitful and dishonest man, who will never admit any fear. Quit and go home? Never. My father would be an outcast in the <em>piazza</em>; his friends, even his good friends, would talk behind his back, saying he is a fool because his son is a fool. I would be welcomed back, of course, at least to my face. <em>Papa</em> would take me aside. “It has not been a whole day, <em>Antonino</em>. Everyone says you are a fool.” I could not do this to him. I cannot go home, if I wanted to go home. But I do not, or I think I do not want to go home.</p>

        <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
        <h3 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">A Little Bastard</h3>

        <p>We were tired and dry, and our fight was near gone. A quiet night on the road, not a soul to be seen, except a boy on the side of the road, his eyes fixed on <em>Luca</em>, still at the front of the line, but no longer on watch. The boy seemed irritated, jumping crazy, like a horse who sense he was picked for gelding. He stood in front of a hovel of a house, that was part collapsed, and the stones that had made up the wall were scattered across the ground, haphazard, with no pattern, as if a fierce storm, or a minor quake had wreaked havoc. I hoped it was not the boy’s home; better he lived in the woods and froze at night, than live in one of these places. As we closed in on him, I see plainly he had something in his right hand, and he was jumping in and out of the shadows, cursing, calling us names, and we ignored him, even <em>Luca</em>. A woman yelled from the hovel, that he should bring a pail of water from the stream, if the stream was not dry. He ignored her, waving his arms like a wild man, while ordering us to stop. <em>Luca</em> calls him “a little bastard,” before a word passed between them, but I understood it, as <em>Luca</em> has never shown fondness for children.</p>
        <p>“Little bastards, all of them,” he said. The boy screams to get <em>Luca's</em> attention. “<em>Buonasera</em>,” he says, as he looked us over, as if buying a mule or a horse.</p>
        <p><em>Luca</em> and <em>Santo</em> ignored him, but I could not.</p>
        <p>“<em>Buonasera</em>. Where is your father?” He shrugged his shoulders. “Where are you men going?” The boy was twelve, maybe thirteen. He moved out of the shadows into the moonlight, and I see him as pitiful frail, dressed out in rags that hung loose off his small frame. Maybe cast- off cloths from an older brother, or a church, or maybe stolen. God forgive me for saying it. His arm was a bone with skin attached, and no muscle, and I believe he was hungry, and I felt pity in my gut, right off. There is a feeling I get, more of a curse, that when I see suffering, I see myself suffering, and then I feel pity. When I saw a man, who was dead in a ditch, I had nightmares for a month; it was me in the ditch and the sonofabitches left me to rot. Better not to look at suffering, than to look and to do nothing. Now I always look away, not to be involved, but this boy caught me off guard.</p>
        <p>“Are you three <em>cavones</em> are going to <em>Messina</em>,” he says to <em>Luca</em>. “Take me with you. I will be no trouble.” <em>Luca</em> turned square to the boy.</p>
        <p>“Did you say ‘<em>cavones</em>?”</p>
        <p>‘<em>Si</em>, I did. <em>Cavones</em>. Nothing but <em>cavones</em>.”</p>
        <p>“You are a wise little shit,” <em>Luca</em> says to the boy, who just grins.</p>
        <p>“How do you know where we are going?” <em>Santo</em> asked. The boy did not answer.</p>
        <p>“You men look like beggars,” he said, laughing hard, like a grown man. “Are you going to beg crumbs from the bishop?” <em>Luca</em> took a step closer to the boy.</p>
        <p>“So, we look like beggars to you? How about I break your arm for fun? Would you like that?” The boy backs away. “We work when there is work. Now there is no work, and we are going to America.” The boy laughed.</p>
        <p>“The <em>Carabinieri</em> will throw your asses into the street, if you do, or maybe jail.” <em>Luca</em> took his arm. “I said ‘America.’ Are you deaf?”</p>
        <p>“America?” The boy laughs, again. “You do not look smart enough to find your ass hole.” This incensed <em>Luca</em>, who made a quick, stab at the boy, and the little bastard cocked his arm, ready to let loose a rock he held in his hand, but <em>Luca</em> knocked it away, and cursed, threatening to beat the boy severely. A woman, his mother I guessed, called him from the stoop.</p>
        <p>“<em>Andrea</em>, get in the house before I…” He half turned and yelled over his shoulder. “These men are taking me to America.” His mother yells for him to get in the house. “My father is in America…take me with you,” he begged <em>Santo</em>, grabbing his arm. To strangers <em>Santo</em> appears to be the most serious of us, as he rarely speaks or smiles, and is always making the sign of the cross, usually with no good reason. People trust him, more than me or <em>Luca</em>.</p>
        <p><em>Santo</em> pulled away and stepped back.</p>
        <p>“I promise not to be trouble,” the boy said. “My father is in America. Help me find him. I will die here if you do not take me with you.” We laughed, except <em>Santo</em>, who hears ‘die,’ and made the sign of the cross. I look at those years, that time on the road, and I see the boy was pleading for help, asking for a chance, but me and <em>Luca</em> only saw the humor of it. Maybe it is fifty years later, and now I am ashamed on how we treated this boy, though he reminded me of my brother, <em>Salvatore</em>, who I left behind. They were the same size and age, but <em>Salvatore</em> was a quiet boy, who never cursed or hurt anything living, or threatened another human being.</p>
        <p>The boy’s mother calls him again, this time pleading for his help; he cursed. I could not hear it clear, as the wind kicked up, but I believe he cursed her. I expected his father would tear out of the house, swinging a stick, and beat this boy’s ass red, but no man came. Who heads this house, I thought to ask, but was it my business? A woman? A woman cannot head the house; who holds it together; who is the boss? She took a step off the stoop, pleading with him to come into the house, but he cursed her straight out this time, and there was no wind to hide his foul mouth. Bad men come from bad boys, <em>papa</em> always said (my grandfather said it first). Her eyes were fired up, and I believe she was ready to battle with this little bastard.</p>
        <p>“Do not dare use that language to me,” she said. “Or I will tell your uncle.” He ignored her and asked us, again, “Take me with you. I want to be <em>Americano</em>.” <em>Luca</em> pushed him toward the shack.</p>
        <p>“I am not you uncle. But I will kick your ass for the fun of it.”</p>
        <p>The boy cursed. “<em>Va' fa' un culo</em> to you,” he said, catching <em>Luca</em> off guard. I think, what balls on this <em>straccione</em> (ragamuffin). In a way I envied the boy, his confidence, but not the disrespect for his mother, or his stupidity for pissing off <em>Luca</em>.</p>
        <p>“<em>Va' fa' un culo</em>,” he said, again, spitting at <em>Lucas</em> feet. <em>Luca</em> struck fast, grabbing the boy’s collar, saying he would wash his mouth out with lye soap, if he brought a bar along. When <em>Luca</em> relaxed his grip, the boy stumbled back and ran to his mother.</p>
