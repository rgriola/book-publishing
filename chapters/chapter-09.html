    <div class="chapter-body">

<p class="calibre6">Santo said he would pray for good weather, but by God, or luck, we had moonlight, but no place to sleep, and in the morning, we fight for a place in line, against men who have planned better and are rested. The losers, maybe us, will pound salt as they wait for the next ferry, if another is allowed; or stare, like jealous old women, as the winners sail away. Desperate men, I know from experience, will pay ten, twenty times the value of a ticket for a place on this ferry. I was in Messina my last post before they discharged me from the army. I guarded the goddamned docks, that takes no more brains than a morning shit. But it was easy duty and I owe it all to good conduct and treating men in authority respectfully. I owe this to a father who ruled his house, in a way good men are supposed to rule. I was no misfit, like Luca, who is too much a proud man, always going his own way, as he sees this as what he is, a free man. For me, I learn the rules I was given to live by, and obey these rules, and life is easier, unless you have been born with some fatal disease, or drink bad water at an early age. Salute. Show respect to all superiors, no matter how you are treated, as treating other men bad is their privilege, and some say a sign of good leadership. Button your mouth shut and learn what they have to teach; in the army it being how to load a rifle and shoot a rifle, but thank God, I never faced the enemy, if there was an enemy, and this made my training useless, except it made the officers feel needed. I do not recall there being an enemy, or anyone called “the enemy,” but in any case, I was not trained to recognize the enemy, as my superiors did it for me. I never killed for them, thank God, but I believe in my heart I would if I was told to, but to save my life, not for medals, or furloughs, or a pat on the back, that means nothing. Papa says we kill, not because we are brave, but that we are afraid not to kill when told it was the right thing. If I killed for them, and there was no good reason to kill, only that they were the enemy, I believe it was Gods duty to see I rotted in hell. “Kill a man, even a woman or a child, if you must to save your life” this old priest says when we were trained, “Or if told to do so by a superior. Never worry, God will forgive you because you were following orders.” One of those old soldiers, always drunk and falling down, one night put his finger in my face and said, very calmly, “you are not a man until you gut another man, with a rusty bayonet.” He laughed and the men around us laughed. The thought of it still gives me sweats, though it was many years ago. I should be thinking about the ferry. I am wandering.    </p>
<p id="page_277" class="calibre6">I recall three, four boats a day went to Calabria and one to Napoli, but the ferry to Napoli was a relic, a castoff from the Italian Navy, likely to sink in the open sea at some time, but I have not heard of it happening. Every boat leaving Messina was loaded with Siciliani fleeing (I say ‘fleeing,’ not ‘leaving’) to some place or another. I figured the boat to Napoli, dilapidated as it was, best fit our plan as it cut out the long train ride from <i class="calibre5">Villa San Giovanni</i>, in <i class="calibre5">Calabria. </i>Santo vetoed this right off, admitting he feared crossing the open sea on a ‘raft,’ as he called it, though he had never been on a raft, or seen a ferry, only hearing drunk talk in the Piazza del Poppolo, from men who said they were on it, and lucky to be alive. What did Santo know? He has not been out of his own way or had both feet off the ground at the same time, except to sleep. But to calm his fears we agreed to the long way, across the Straits of Messina to Villa San Giovanni and the train to Napoli, not the simple ride across the Tyrrhenian Sea.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">America</i>. We are going to <i class="calibre5">America. </i> I like to say it and hear the sound of it. <i class="calibre5">America.</i></p>
<p class="calibre6">We walked on to Messina, riot, or no. My feet and my legs were sore and aching, but I went on, and in hours we saw the small signs we were nearing a city, and this gave me hope and some relief from the pain. The trees were not as tall and full, as we were walking away from the great forest, and the hills flattened out to the sea. The air was thinner now and did not smell so much of fish. I believe the wind changes near Messina, and the fish smell stays out at sea. I see the flickering lights ahead, below the horizon line, and this meant life. Then it hit me and I was dizzy from it, the thought that I was going to America, some alien world, where I have not been invited, and who says they will let me in, or if they do, they would not let me stay loo long, or I will get in, but hate it worse than bad pain, then what do I do?  .           “Forget the foolishness…go home,” a voice in my ear said it clearly, and I turn to the others and asked if they heard the same voice. They did not, or they did and would not admit it, as most believe only the crazy hear voices. I am not crazy, but I heard these voices all the time.    </p>
<p id="page_278" class="calibre6">The old man on the mule. I admit his story of riots and murder undid me some, as did *<i class="calibre5">Gennaro Fiorini</i>, the fisherman back on the beach, and it is worse since the sun has dropped behind the mountain. I hate the night. I fear it. Whosoever says he is not afraid of the night, is a deceitful and dishonest man, who will never admit any fear. Quit and go home? Never.  My father would be an outcast in the piazza; his friends, even his good friends, would talk behind his back, saying he is a fool because his son is a fool. I would be welcomed back, of course, at least to my face. Papa would take me aside. “It has not been a whole day, Antonino. Everyone says you are a fool.” I could not do this to him. I cannot go home, if I wanted to go home. But I do not, or I think I do not want to go home. </p>
<p class="calibre6">We were tired and dry, and our fight was near gone. A quiet night on the road, not a soul to be seen, except a boy on the side of the road, his eyes fixed on Luca, still at the front of the line, but no longer on watch. The boy seemed irritated, jumping crazy, like a horse who sense he was picked for gelding. He stood in front of a hovel of a house, that was part collapsed, and the stones that had made up the wall were scattered across the ground, haphazard, with no pattern, as if a fierce storm, or a minor quake had wreaked havoc. I hoped it was not the boy’s home; better he lived in the woods and froze at night, than live in one of these places. As we closed in on him, I see plainly he had something in his right hand, and he was jumping in and out of the shadows, cursing, calling us names, and we ignored him, even Luca. A woman yelled from the hovel, that he should bring a pail of water from the stream, if the stream was not dry. He ignored her, waving his arms like a wild man, while ordering us to stop. Luca calls him “a little bastard,” before a word passed between them, but I understood it, as Luca has never shown fondness for children.   </p>
<p id="page_279" class="calibre6">“Little bastards, all of them,” he said. The boy screams to get Luca’s attention.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Buonasera,” he says, as he looked us over, as if buying a mule or a horse.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca and Santo ignored him, but I could not.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Buonasera. Where is your father?” He shrugged his shoulders.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where are you men going?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The boy was twelve, maybe thirteen. He moved out of the shadows into the moonlight, and I see him as pitiful frail, dressed out in rags that hung loose off his small frame. Maybe cast-off cloths from an older brother, or a church, or maybe stolen. God forgive me for saying it. His arm was a bone with skin attached, and no muscle, and I believe he was hungry, and I felt pity in my gut, right off. There is a feeling I get, more of a curse, that when I see suffering, I see myself suffering, and then I feel pity. When I saw a man, who was dead in a ditch, I had nightmares for a month; it was me in the ditch and the sonofabitches left me to rot. Better not to look at suffering, than to look and to do nothing. Now I always look away, not to be involved, but this boy caught me off guard.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you three <i class="calibre5">cavones</i> are going to Messina,” he says to Luca. “Take me with you. I will be no trouble.” Luca turned square to the boy. </p>
<p id="page_280" class="calibre6">“Did you say ‘<i class="calibre5">cavones</i>?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">‘Si, I did. <i class="calibre5">Cavones</i>. Nothing but c<i class="calibre5">avones</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are a wise little shit,” Luca says to the boy, who just grins.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How do you know where we are going?” Santo asked. The boy did not answer.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You men look like beggars,” he said, laughing hard, like a grown man.  “Are you going to beg crumbs from the bishop?” Luca took a step closer to the boy. </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “So, we look like beggars to you? How about I break your arm for fun? Would you like that?” The boy backs away. “We work when there is work. Now there is no work, and we are going to America.” The boy laughed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The Carabinieri will throw your asses into the street, if you do, or maybe jail.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca took his arm. “I said ‘America.’ Are you deaf?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“America?” The boy laughs, again. “You do not look smart enough to find your ass hole.” This incensed Luca, who made a quick, stab at the boy, and the little bastard cocked his arm, ready to let loose a rock he held in his hand, but Luca knocked it away, and cursed, threatening to beat the boy severely.  A woman, his mother I guessed, called him from the stoop.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">*“Andrea, get in the house before I…”  He half turned and yelled over his shoulder.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“These men are taking me to America.” His mother yells for him to get in the house.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My father is in America…take me with you,” he begged Santo, grabbing his arm. To strangers Santo appears to be the most serious of us, as he rarely speaks or smiles, and is always making the sign of the cross, usually with no good reason. People trust him, more than me or Luca.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo pulled away and stepped back.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I promise not to be trouble,” the boy said. “My father is in America. Help me find him. I will die here if you do not take me with you.” We laughed, except Santo, who hears ‘die,’ and made the sign of the cross. I look at those years, that time on the road, and I see the boy was pleading for help, asking for a chance, but me and Luca only saw the humor of it. Maybe it is fifty years later, and now I am ashamed on how we treated this boy, though he reminded me of my brother, Salvatore, who I left behind. They were the same size and age, but Salvatore was a quiet boy, who never cursed or hurt anything living, or threatened another human being.    </p>
<p id="page_281" class="calibre6">The boy’s mother calls him again, this time pleading for his help; he cursed. I could not hear it clear, as the wind kicked up, but I believe he cursed <i class="calibre5">her</i>. I expected his father would tear out of the house, swinging a stick, and beat this boy’s ass red, but no man came. Who heads this house, I thought to ask, but was it my business? A woman? A woman cannot head the house; who holds it together; who is the boss?  She took a step off the stoop, pleading with him to come into the house, but he cursed her straight out this time, and there was no wind to hide his foul mouth. Bad men come from bad boys, papa always said (my grandfather said it first). Her eyes were fired up, and I believe she was ready to battle with this little bastard.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do not dare use that language to me,” she said. “Or I will tell your uncle.” He ignored her and asked us, again, “Take me with you. I want to be Americano.” Luca pushed him toward the shack.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am not you uncle. But I will kick your ass for the fun of it.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The boy cursed. “<i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo</i> to you,” he said, catching Luca off guard. I think, what balls on this straccione (ragamuffin).  In a way I envied the boy, his confidence, but not the disrespect for his mother, or his stupidity for pissing off Luca.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo</i>,” he said, again, spitting at Lucas feet. Luca struck fast, grabbing the boy’s collar, saying he would wash his mouth out with lye soap, if he brought a bar along. When Luca relaxed his grip, the boy stumbled back and fell to the ground. He was still feisty and mouthy, and a fighter, for a scarecrow of a boy; with guts, I admit, but no power. Luca lays his foot into the boy’s chest, and played, letting him up halfway, then pushing him down.        </p>
<p id="page_282" class="calibre6">“Where is your father?” Luca demanded. “He should be here to kick your ass.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The boy struggled the harder when Luca asked about his father.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Gone…but when he comes back for me, he will find you and beat you good for this.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca shook his head. “No wonder he is gone. A little bastard like you for a son.” He soon tired of keeping the boy down and let him up and tried to brush off his jacket, but the boy pushed his hand away. Luca grabbed him again.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What is your father’s name?” When the boy refused to answer, Luca twisted his arm, some, and the boy squealed, like a pig, and his mother begged him not to hurt her son. “He is all I have,” she pleads, and when Luca hears this, his ears perk, like a good hunting dog.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who is your father?” Luca asked. The boy straightened himself and stared Luca in the eye. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“*<i class="calibre5">Generoso Parelli</i>, is his name and I swear you will pay for beating me.” Luca laughed at this threat to his well wellbeing.  I took Luca by the arm.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Andiamo. Let’s go,” I said. We started walking, but Luca lingered.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where <i class="calibre5">is</i> your father?” he asks the boy.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“In America,” he answered, calmly. “Take me with you, to America. Leave me there and I will find him on my own.” Luca laughed and this pissed off the boy.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Bring you to America? The disrespect you show your poor mother, I would not carry your ass across the road.” The mother did not interfere, as I believe she was grateful for help controlling her rude son, sensing that Luca would not harm him, except for the barely twisted arm, and the boy would be easier to control after being brought down to size by a man.    </p>
<p id="page_283" class="calibre6">She was a beautiful young woman, and this surprised me, as women who live her life are mostly old and haggard before they are thirty. She was thirty, maybe more, and “fetching,” as *<i class="calibre5">Enzo</i>, an honored friend would say about her. Slim. But not slim like a young girl, and tall for a woman, taller than her son. Standing in the moonlight, that did fair justice to her fine features; she lectured her son, her hand resting on his shoulder, but he was bored and looked away. How clean she looked, for the hovel she lived in, and I was sorry for her that she had borne a disrespectful son and had no man, as I could see. Luca enjoys lean women, he says, as they are “lively,” able to keep up with a good man and not fall behind. But he thinks little of woman, I am sorry to say, but for things they do to make his life easier; cook, clean and, well, his “comfort.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">My Carmela, she is slim and fetching, like a fine foto on a wall. Or a marble statue.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The boy’s mother had a quality of plain beauty that was not lost on Luca, as he stared at her like a man who has not seen a woman before, yet she was not uncomfortable or embarrassed, as I could see. She took the boy by the arm and pulled, hard.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Say you are sorry to these good men.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">This little <i class="calibre5">straccione</i> refused and pulled away. When Luca curled his fist, the boy cursed and spit on his boot. “My father is no finocchio(queer), like you three,” he yells, as he ran into the shadows. Luca chased after the boy, who was fast and nimble and screaming, “<i class="calibre5">va' fa' un culo, va' fa' un culo</i>,” until Luca was crazy.  “<i class="calibre5">Va' fa' un culo</i> to you,” Luca yells back, but with his youth the boy easily outran and out maneuvered Luca, losing himself in the darkness, then appearing here and there the moonlight, as if he had a battle plan. He played with Luca, who could not measure up to the pace of this crazy boy. His mother waited meekly in the moonlight, not protesting, as she watched the race in and out of the shadows. Her goods look and warm features and some begging would have saved her son from a good beating, but if he was beaten,  it would not have been severe. Luca was a tough man, fearing nothing, but he threatened many more beatings than he gave, as the threat itself was usually enough. Luca finally gives up the chase and leaned against an oak, coughing and gasping for air, admitting he was not the man he used to be. This woman walked to the tree, and they stood together, talking quietly and I strained to hear what they said. She edged closer to Luca, cocking her head slightly to the right, and the light from a blue moon washed over the side of her face and I decided she was <i class="calibre5">comely </i>(a word I heard Enzo use).  </p>
<p id="page_284" class="calibre6"> She looked up at Luca, as he was much taller, and smiled.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My name is *<i class="calibre5">Lucia Formica</i>,” and he all but melted at her feet, like ice off the mountain, in the summer sun.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Lucia? A beautiful name. I am Luca…Luca, Lucia. I hope we are not related.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">They repeat their names, “Luca, Lucia,” laughing, like two foolish beings. What was the humor in it? I did not see, or did Santo, who shook his head. How might they be related because their first names were similar? It made no sense to me.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am sorry for Andrea’s behavior,” she said.  “All he talks about is America. America, America. <i class="calibre5">Mangia l’america</i>, I say. But he has wanted to go to America since his father…” She stopped and looked away. “Since his father is no longer here.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca smiled. “Then he <i class="calibre5">is</i> in America. I thought your son was telling stories…but he is in America?” He tried not to show his happiness that she was alone, without a man, or too eager, considering she was still a married woman. She moved back a step, to a more respectable place, nervously wiping her hands on the apron she wore, while staring at the ground. </p>
<p id="page_285" class="calibre6">“No, signuri, I lied to my son when I told him his father went to America. No, my husband, *<i class="calibre5">Generoso Parelli</i> , is not in America, as his son believes. He is,” she paused, “God help him, in the Kings prison, only a few miles from here.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Prison?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. He rots in a Siclianu prison. And he did it for me…I am so ashamed.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A Sicilianu prison,” Luca repeated, then turned and looked at me. “I am sorry to hear of your suffering, and now I understand why your son is a little…well, what I mean, he is a rebellious boy.” He touched her shoulder, near her neck, that was bare, and I thought she would step back, but she never moved.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca seemed pleased. “Did he murder someone? A man who deserved it, no doubt.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, no, not that.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then he beat a man who insulted you. So how can he be faulted?”  But why did he think of ‘murder,’ not some simple crime, that would give her husband few years in jail. Then I see it clear, he wanted her, this woman he just met, hoping there was a waiting noose for her husband, or the firing squad, and she would be free. Murder? It made sense, if you knew Luca, and how his mind will design from nothing whatever end he needs.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">She made the sign of the cross but did not look Luca in the eye.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, signuri. My husband is a good man…not a murderer, not even a violent man. It was me. I complained about the way we lived, that we were always hungry. But everyone here is hungry all the time.” She turns away. “He stole food for us. A goat, and it is my fault.” Luca took her hand, but she was embarrassed and pulled away.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca had nothing to say, as I could see. Finally, he clears his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A man is no man if he cannot feed his family. But he should have gone to the Church.”   </p>
<p id="page_286" class="calibre6">“No, signuri, my husband is too proud. It was his failure, alone, she said.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You were starving. He took from others who had too much. I cannot fault him for it.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">She smiled. “How kind you are say it. He is a proud man, like his father. He refused to ask the Kings men for mercy, so I begged for mercy in his place. We <i class="calibre5">were</i> hungry and the goat was old and worthless, but the magistrate laughed. ‘Full belly or starving, old goat, new goat, a thief is a thief,’ he said, and I will never forget his words, or the smile on his face when he said, “six years of hard labor,”  for a goat, half dead, but property of Santo Rocco, near Messina.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca shook his head. “I see now, he stole from the Church. Where did they steal it? Who better to steal from?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, signuri. Not exactly the Church, but the priests, the Scalabrini’s, who do charitable work in America. That was the evil of it, they said. But the priests owed him money for a week’s work, repairing doors and windows; but they refused to pay, saying the work was inferior, and they ordered my husband away, threatening him with Carribieneri. He snatched the goat,   knocking a priest to the ground, and ran, but he was captured on this very road walking home from Messina, and beaten severely by the Carribieneri after they locked him in the cell. I went to Messina to beg the bishop, waiting six hours in the sun, until I see him leave the Cathedral. I followed him down the street, begging forgiveness for my husband. I made the mistake, I called him “Patri,” and he corrected me, “your eminence,” he said, and I knew I had angered him. His ‘eminence’ said he could not help my husband a second time, as the Son of God pardoned him once, when He died on the cross for our sins. I did not understand what he meant, but that my husband rots in prison for a goat. Near five more years.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">She batted at bugs that buzz around her head and she moved into the shadow of a large oak. Luca followed her (like a dog in heat). It was hard to hear what was said, but I believe she was living off the charity of others, as the famine (it had not rained in months) worsened each day. Nothing grew, and the peddlers from Messina were afraid to come and sell as they were robbed when they did, and a few days ago one was knifed and left on the side of the road. She did odd work for her landlord (not offering the nature of her work, but I am certain it was honorable) but she is still behind in the rent and waits for the day the Carribieneri come and throw her family into the street. I learned she bore two more children, a son, a daughter, both dead from the fever before they could walk. Their deaths, she said with sorrow, was a blessing, as they would surely <i class="calibre5">all</i> starve today with two more mouths to feed. Ten children, from here to Messina, have died this year, and two mothers, not including *<i class="calibre5">Signora Buzza</i>, who hung herself from an oak, rather than see another die from starvation.   </p>
<p id="page_287" class="calibre6">“My husband rots in a prison, where they die of consumption before the end of their sentence. I do not believe he will survive five more years in that hell.” She held up five fingers; four on her left hand, one on her right hand, repeating “five more years in hell.” She caught sight of her son hiding in the shadows and brought him out while lecturing him on his foul language and his disrespect.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">She said, with fire in her eyes, “If your father was here…God help you.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But he is <i class="calibre5">not</i> here,” the boy yells back. “He’s in America and will never come back.” He pulled harder, but she held tight, and dragged his scrawny body into the house.  I felt sorry for her; alone, in that hovel of a shack, with no man and a disrespectful son. Luca followed her to the stoop, and they spoke alone and quietly for a long time. When they said goodbye, I see he was shy and uncomfortable, but took her hand and patted her shoulder. As we started down the road to Messina, I hear him repea, “Luca, Lucia.  Luca, Lucia.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It has a pleasant sound to it,” I said. Luca thought she had a fire in her heart.   </p>
<p id="page_288" class="calibre6"> “Yes, she has fire, and a husband. Too close to that fire and you get burned.” He agreed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I know. But he <i class="calibre5">is</i> a thief and a bad thief, and he will die in prison. If I was not going…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But you are.” I said, and again he agreed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She invited me…well, all of us, to stop on the way back, if we come back soon. By then she may be living at Via Messina, 5, upstairs, in the back, with her mother, who is a difficult woman. My promise to Luca said we might stop and check on the boy, “But many things will happen between now and then.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Who knows? I might have taken the boy with us, if she asked. When he is old enough, she will send him off to the army, and he will eat better, and she can use the few lire the army pays. I do not care for the army, but what chance does he have here? This is why we are leaving.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A boy along would be no trouble,” Luca says, watching me from the corner of his eye. He e could do the shit work.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo said no. “A boy along? I do not like the idea”   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> I kept a picture of Salvatore in my shirt pocket, a good likeness drawn neatly by my sister, Maria, who is the only Sparacino with a talent from God. I admired the picture, though it was pencil and fading, and hard to see in the blue light of the moon. I thought of him and my family, and the time I might return and live out my life in the place where I was born, like men should do. I kissed my brother for the last time, because this wonderful picture was lost by my carelessness, or stolen by some bastard, for its beauty.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I never said this, but my father wanted me to take Salvatore to America. I lied to his face, that I could not, and blamed you two men.” Santo punched my arm.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Anyway, they will both survive, your brother, this boy…what is his name?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Andrea,” I said. “*Andrea Parelli.” </p>
<p id="page_289" class="calibre6">‘Si. Andrea. And your brother, Salvatore. What can happen to young men?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe you are right. My brother…this boy, Andrea. They <i class="calibre5">are</i> young. What can happen? Nothing.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca laughs. “So, you blamed me? Sonofabitch,” he said. “I will tell your father the truth when I see him.”   </p>
