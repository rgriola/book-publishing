<div class="chapter-body">

<p class="calibre4">We knew it, that <i class="calibre5">Giacomo Restunni</i> was a great man. Back on the boat he warned us, “Stand like a man. Never droop your body, or act like an ape,” and he bent over and walked and stared at the floor to show what he meant. “If you stoop, like a <i class="calibre5">scimmie</i> (an ape), they will treat you like an ape,” and we laughed, but he scolded like children.  “Never look them in the eye, refuse to cower like a whipped dog, and never tell the truth if a lie serves you better. Never cough or complain or mention aches and pains. “Fuck all aches and pains,” he shouted. They need us to work, to keep them rich, so we must be healthy, like good mules, so any weakness will not be tolerated, or will they take sick women or sick children. We are the cattle sale, and only the strong, or those who look strong, are allowed to stay.”  This was fifty years ago, maybe more, but it is like yesterday in my head. Maybe it was, how do I know. These goddamn pills, I never know if today is today, or yesterday or I am talking about tomorrow, or last week., or I imagine I am talking and I am really asleep. This place I am in, maybe for the last time, is best for the dead, and the dead who are near dead, but not dead yet. They keep me alive, but are they killing me? I watch it all, things that happened in the past, on the wall at the end of my bed. It is like being at the *<i class="calibre5">East </i>(a movie house), but with no popcorn. I have loved popcorn since I come here, but *<i class="calibre5">Joe-Joe</i> no longer sells his newspapers on Main Street. All gone. It is all gone.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I sleep most of the day, if I am able, but when I am awake, it is always harvest time, way back. <i class="calibre5">Si. </i>It is always the Fall or beginning of Winter. I was a picker; the best picker in the province, at least my village. What future is there for a man on his knees, picking beans twelve hours a day. So, I say this, but respectfully, that I wanted a good life, a better place in this goddamned world.    </p>
<p id="page_3" class="calibre6">“Teach us to read, maybe write a little,” I say to the <i class="calibre5">capu’s</i>, the rich men. They sit and listen, never smiling, never speaking, but they pass the time rubbing the sleeves on their fine jackets, and lighting and relighting the same cigar. Then they will talk among themselves, and always, in the end, they say we know what we need to know to pick beans and shovel shit. Me, I am a ‘<i class="calibre5">contadini</i>, ’a ‘peasant,’ and worthless, except when I am kneeling and picking. Kneeling and picking crops owned by rich men, who are lazy; or sometimes stretching and picking their fruit.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">I lived by the Golden Rule for a peasant: “Always be picking.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Read and write? What is the value of it if all you do is pick beans and shovel shit?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Land? You want land? Land is nothing but a nuisance. How will you pay the taxes, if all you can do is pick beans and shovel shit? Your father could not read or write, or did he own land, or his father before him, and they were good men, happy and grateful for what they had, everything we gave them.” It seemed right, what they said, as it had always been this way; but in time, I knew it was a lie.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">A great man and a friend, Enzo Baneri said I had the “wonder.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Wonder? Wonder is a disease,” said the capu. “For a man like you “Wonder” is a serious business, a dangerous thing, a loaded gun in a child’s hands. A curse best left to the men at this table. Si, I understand,” I said and left peacefully, leaving them to finish their sausages and drink the good wine provided by *Signuri <i class="calibre5">Palazzo</i> and Signuri <i class="calibre5">Cervicale</i>, both married men, who fuck whores in <i class="calibre5">Palermu </i>and the capu’s know it and do not care. I pray they will all rot in hell.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">One day in the fields, it was so hot the sweat soaked through me, but I kept working, as it was the rule. I see him coming, <i class="calibre5">Il capo</i>, a runt of a man, but as big as the mountain. It was hard to look at him straight on, like the sun. *<i class="calibre5">Signuri Castello </i>was a wealthy man and a great landowner, and my family worked for him many years. That day he came to the fields only to watch me work, so I was told. He was like a sick child, weak and frail, but strong enough to bellow and suck all day on a Sicilian stogie (<i class="calibre5">always</i> one in his mouth and his teeth were brown, like dirt) and I was sickened by his smell. He held the juice in his mouth until it leaked through his lips, bubbling, and dripping onto his chin. That day I was filling the wood pails faster than his overseer could count, and for this he paid pennies, if he paid at all.  One day I asked, “I picked you fifty pails…my hands are raw and bleeding. You paid for forty.” He sighed, like a woman annoyed, as he brings out his notebook, licked his stained finger and flipped through the pages. “Your family,” he said, not looking me in the eye, “owes money, for a goat your grandfather recklessly killed some years back. I was gentle with your people and did not call the law.”  </p>
<p id="page_4" class="calibre6">It always made sense, what these people said.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">This day he stood over me, that runt of a man who never did a days’ work, shouting how he enjoyed watching my young hands cut through the air; if only his other workers worked half as fast. He took my hands, rubbed them hard and smiled. He spit juice at a rock, half buried in the ground. His weak and pathetic body blocked the heat of the sun, as I knelt in his shadow; not much, but it was all he ever did for me.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are a fine example for the other pickers,” he said. “Too bad you cannot teach them the glory of hard work, as they are lazy, good for nothings. You deserve a bonus for your good work, but sadly, the crops are bad this year and I have no extra money. Remind me next year if things are better, but I am promising you nothing, as I owe you nothing, but you owe me, and your whole family owes me.”  Inside, I laughed at his talk of ‘bonus,’ but I admit enjoying his praise; honored he said it to no other picker, as far as I knew. So, I picked faster, ignoring the aches, the pain, and his lies. He praised me, and I felt like a man, though I was still a child.  </p>
<p id="page_5" class="calibre6">“Never be rich,” was the wisdom he shared with me, nodding his head as if it made the words more the truth. “The world is full of lying and cheating sonofabitches. Bastards who will steal the skin off your body, if they can. These cigars,” he patted his shirt pocket, “I pay up the <i class="calibre5">culo</i> for the best, but even these bastards use inferior tobacco, if I never check. When I see them, they will pay for their dishonesty.” He rubbed the top of my head and smiled and pointed to me, like a friend. “But you…you have never cheated me, as far as I know.” He slapped the side of my head. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Have you ever cheated me?” he asked, staring right between my eyes.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Maybe I have cheated him, but this was not time for the truth?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, <i class="calibre5">signore</i>, of course not. I would…” He smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Good.  When you cheat me, you might live a little better, but I suffer. This I cannot have. So, I have a gift for you, a gift I give to my best men, my best workers.” He curled his lip while he thought. “Did I say gift? No. Not a gift. A gift is from one friend to another. We are not friends, are we? No. This is a reward for your hard work and service to me and men like me, who are the important men. Like an *<i class="calibre5">indennita</i> for your good work. Si, an <i class="calibre5">indennita </i>is a small bonus, and the bonus I give to you is advice, and advice from a man like me is, well, priceless. Like words from God, Himself.” I stare at him, still on my knees; he moved his scrawny body, and now I was staring into the blinding son, and he thought this was funny and laughed. I squinted. I covered my eyes with the left hand, but still picking beans with my right.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Grazie, signuri</i>, but my family cannot eat this <i class="calibre5">indennita</i> of advice. This is an…” </p>
<p id="page_6" class="calibre6">Should I say it, this <i class="calibre5">infamia</i>? Papa said I could not keep my Sicilian mouth shut. Say what I am thinking, and Castello might punch my face and who would care? But I will say it and fuck him. I took a deep breath and cleared my throat.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Uh, signuri *<i class="calibre5">Castello</i>, if you see your way to pay one more cent a pail for the beans we pick, our life will be better, and you, and the other capu’s, it is so little and you have so much, your life will be the same.” He froze where he stood, his heart beating fast, that I could see through the fine shirt he wore, maybe silk. He coughed and staggered, but recovered, leaning his frail body against a tree.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He screamed, like a <i class="calibre5">pazzo</i>, a madman. “You want more from me, and after I praised your work?” He slapped wildly at my head, and thank God he was old and feeble, and I could follow his hand and there was time to back away. He slapped again, and missed again, so he ordered me to sit and take the hit I deserved, and I did, whimpering that he might feel like a man(he was not)  and maybe he would leave me alone.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Signuri Castello, mi dispiace,</i>I am sorry for my insult to you, but I want you to know it is an honor to work for such a respected man, like you. Yes, you are right, we are not worth another cent a pail.”  He stopped and smiled.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are correct. Not another cent,” he said, spitting juice from between his teeth. “But I say you have balls for two men. Maybe you have a future in the fields, but peasants worry too much about money. I have always had it, and I can tell you there is more to this life than being rich, like me.” A cent more a pail would bankrupt him, he said, swearing an oath to God it was the truth, but reminding me he owed no explanation to the workers. “You are nothing, nobodies,” he said. He pointed his finger straight at my eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“For a lira, maybe less, I can buy half the pickers, like you, to kill the other half.”  </p>
<p id="page_7" class="calibre6">He cleared his throat and spit on the ground. “God help me, I have done my best to look out for you people.” He made the sign of the cross. I near believed him, told him he was a respected man, but he laughed, as he certainly knew when he died, we would fight to be the first man to piss on his grave. Soon. Please make it soon.           </p>
<p class="calibre6">He put his hand on my shoulder. “You insult me,” he said, “but I will still reward your loyal service to me. Advice is like gold when it comes from a man like me. <i class="calibre5">Ascolti,</i> listen, it is simple, even for peasants to understand, and this one time you may stop working, so you hear what I say and understand it.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Stop working? Is he sick? Has he allowed this before, or am I the first?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He took my arm and shook me hard.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you listening? Peasants never listen. This is why you are all poor.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, of course, <i class="calibre5">Signuri Castello</i>, you are right.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The wind off the mountain kicked up dirt and sand and dead brush, and the capu turned away, cursing. When the wind shifted, he brushed at his fine jacket and complained how he hated this time of year, when the winds played tricks and blew dust and dirt in his “old” eyes. I see it was a bad time for a man like him, used to being comfortable, demanding complete satisfaction in all things. He became quiet and solemn and made the sign of the cross, raising his tired eyes to God. He cleared his throat. I waited to hear this great reward, his gift of advice. He spit and cleared his throat, the little sonofabitch he was, No good for anything, but to spit and shit and smoke cigars and watch other men work in the boiling sun, to keep him rich.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Obey the rule,” he said, repeating it. “Obey the rule. And if you do, I promise you will have an easy life. Not a good life. You are a peasant. You cannot have a good life. But an easier life than peasants who do not obey the rule.”            </p>
<p id="page_8" class="calibre6">Obey the rule? I was confused. What rule? There are many rules. I asked him, “rules for  picking beans?” I am a peasant. What did I know?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He shook his head and I see disgust in his face.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, idiot,” he said, spitting juice on the ground, for maybe the fourth time.  “Only a fool would think that. If that is what you think, then I was wrong. <i class="calibre5">You</i> are a fool, like the rest, but you work hard. I like you, fool and all.” He stared at me, like a beggar, himself.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you smoke? If you smoke lend me a stogie.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiace</i>, signuri, but I do not smoke. My lungs…ruined since birth. I will…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He pushed his fragile hand at my face.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did I ask for the story of your life? I did not. I asked for a stogie. But it is good you do not smoke. Never smoke. It is too expensive for a man like you, with nothing, and a luxury you will never afford. These are the best cigars, made from tobacco grown in the Orient...<i class="calibre5">solo il migliore</i>. I buy only the best…are you jealous of me…I know you are, and so you should be.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He grabbed my shoulder.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Look at me when I am speaking to you,” he said, more anger in his voice. “What have you learned, so far?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Never smoke cigars, I see. Grazie, signuri Castello. You give good advice. It is a good reward, like you said. Si, yes, I will always obey the rule…never smoke cigars.” When I stood up, he pushed me back to the wet earth. My knee hit the point of a rock buried in the dirt, and I screamed, some, but he showed me no sympathy, only laughter and contempt.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You deserve pain, you peasant fool, because you have not stated the rule, and you should know it.” I cowered. He poked at my chest. “A goddamned peasant is a goddamned peasant. You should be picking. Why are you not picking?”  </p>
<p id="page_9" class="calibre6">I trembled.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will ignore your insult and ignorance this once,” he said. “My overseer, *<i class="calibre5">Tenucci</i>, tells me he has never had a reason to beat you, or threaten you, because you work hard and never complain, which are fine qualities for a man to have, but ‘<i class="calibre5">never smoke cigars</i> ,’ is not the rule, and only a fool would say it. There is only one rule.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He sneered and grabbed for my collar, near falling to the ground.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Listen…hear what I say, and if you are foolish, or crazy and ignore this rule, your life will be full of pain, grief and sorrow, and when you are dead and done, your soul will likely rot in hell for eternity. God almighty says it’s right, so there is no other way.”  He paced and preached at the same time, while I picked his beans. After a while, he ordered me to “stop picking and stand, like a man,” and he put his hands on my shoulders. I shit my pants. I always shit my pants when the boss was close.          </p>
<p class="calibre6">He looks toward the heavens. “I am about to give you the rule,” he shouts at me. “This is the rule. Are you listening to me? Are you ready to receive it, as I will say it only once?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I cowered in front of him. He liked it; I could tell by his smile, that was wide.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you are ready,” he said, “tell me by kneeling in front of me.”  I did what he said.    </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Si, signuri Castello. I am ready.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He stared down at me, like the lord he was. “<i class="calibre5">Know your place</i>,” he said quietly.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you listening, <i class="calibre5">cavone</i>? Could it be I was wrong about you?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are not wrong, signuri. How could you ever be wrong? I hear every word you say.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He patted my shoulder.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Good boy. I knew you would understand. But ‘<i class="calibre5">know your place</i>,’ is only half the rule. Not only ‘<i class="calibre5">know your place</i>,’ you must <i class="calibre5">be happy in it</i>, as your place in the world has been chosen by God, himself. He screamed it: “<i class="calibre5">Know your place and be happy in it.” </i>A little bit of piss ran down my leg, I am ashamed to say.     </p>
<p id="page_10" class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">This</i> is the rule,” he said. “The rule our God made for your kind. <i class="calibre5">Know your place and be happy in it.</i> Say it back to me, so I know you are listening and understand what I say.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I repeated, “<i class="calibre5">know your place and be happy in it.</i> ”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Say it again.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Know your place and be happy in it.</i>” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I was still kneeling on the ground picking, listening and picking, like the coward I was, afraid of a frail and pathetic old man. I begged to ask a question. “Una <i class="calibre5">domanda</i>, signuri Castello” I say, and his anger grew, by the look in his eyes; he raised the stick he carried. I shrank closer to the ground, like a snake and I covered my head, waiting for the beating. But that day Signuri Castello was full of mercy, so he said. No beating today, or tomorrow, or the next day, even if I deserved it. How grateful I was for this mercy, like we were almost brothers. What bothers me to this day, my belief it was his right to beat me when I did not obey or work as hard as I could; that picking slow, no matter the reason, is stealing and stealing is wrong and against Gods law. He leaned to me, his face in my face, and all I see was juice running from the corner of his mouth. He put his face in my face. I stopped working for what reason I did not know.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Work,” he screamed, his fist clenched. “Never stop working, if you work for me.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Sweat dripped into my eyes, burning like fire, or salt in a wound.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am sorry, Signuri Castello. I mean you no insult, but your rule…”  He yelled, crazy. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is God’s rule…not my rule.” He thundered and I swear the ground shook. I bury my face in the wet dirt, swearing not to look until it was over. I believe he called down lightning to strike me dead, but no lightening came, and maybe I imagined it, or he <i class="calibre5">was</i> a good and decent man, and he spared my life. It made sense. Why kill off the young men like me, who made him money and kept him rich; like his fruit trees, his bean fields, his livestock, and we will make him money for years. He became calm and peaceful, almost pleasant. I was thankful he did not beat me, or call down fire, and when he spoke, I listened out of gratitude.  </p>
<p id="page_11" class="calibre6">“Never lust for what I have, it is a waste of time. Lust for other things, like fallen women and wine, and never crave land, and never think to leave this place where you were born. You belong here, like the dirt; and I forgot to say it, but this is part of the rule.”  <i class="calibre5">Signuri Castello</i> swore he was a believer, a good Catholic, a kind and generous man, who lived only to please God, but these rich bastards said the same thing. They loved God, because God gave them what they had. He grabbed my arm and pulled me off the ground, walked me to a piece of land away from the good land and closer to the woods.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Look here,” he said, pointing to the rocks and thick brush covering the ground, that was not a fit place for goats to shit, but he smiled, and proudly, waving his arm across the horizon and this pitiful piece of earth.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This land you see is all mine, passed to me by generations of hardworking ancestors and worked with my sweat, but most of all, my prayers and donations to the Church of Santa Agata, in the village. Your family, you may use a small piece and think of it as your own, if it makes you feel good. But it is not yours to own and never will be, as this is also part of the rule; never own anything of value, as worldly things of value just confuse the peasant. But you will pay rent for this privilege of living on it, and I expect you will tell the world behind my back that you were cheated. Say it if it makes you feel good.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We have never owned land,” I said. He smiled.   </p>
<p id="page_12" class="calibre6">“Of course not. I said it was part of the rule. You must be deaf, or you were not listening. You cannot own land. You cannot buy the land even if I sell it. If you could become a rich landowner, like me, then what is the point to all of this. How many rich landowners can there be? The rules would mean nothing if a peasant like you could become rich and powerful. My God, do you understand?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I understood.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">A few years later, during another famine and drought, we were suffering more than we ever suffered, but I went to Signuri Castello and begged for his help and mercy. His house servant, *<i class="calibre5">Giuseppina Bartoni</i>, met me at the door (Castello was the father of her two children…the whole village knew it, yet he laughed and denied it, saying it was not possible, as she was a peasant woman, a contadini, not worth fucking, but her bastard children wanted for nothing).  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Signuri Castello is relaxing under the chestnut tree,” she said, staring away, showing me little interest and no respect. “He works too hard and gives so much. Do not bother him or making him angry. He needs his rest.” I knew this tree she spoke of, along the stream, where he hid and watched the young girls swim, and did other things there, so his field workers say. He was there enjoying the shade; now a fat, old man, drinking wine, tearing pieces from a chunk of meat, like a dog. He saw me and stared at me with his fiery green eyes. I wanted to leave, telling him as I left, “<i class="calibre5">mi scusa</i> , it has all been a mistake,” but we were starving.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why are you not working?” he said, spitting juice from the right side of his mouth. “It is the middle of the day.” He clenched his right fist and pounded his open left hand. “I should have beaten you years ago.” He took a long drag on his stogie, spit again and wiped on the sleeve of his shirt; a fine shirt, made in Milano, they say. He asked, did I like his shirt; I nod, and he smiled(he had only a few teeth left in his mouth).  </p>
<p id="page_13" class="calibre6">“Of course,” he said. “What peasant would not want this shirt for his own?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I could not stop the shaking, ashamed I was no man.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Signuri Castello, forgive me for bothering you while you relax, but my family, we are starving.” I waited for a sign, maybe a word of sympathy.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Niente</i>. Nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre6">I stare at the ground, never at his eyes. These men get angry when you look into their eyes(they believe you can see their soul, I have been told). “Can you spare my family a little of the food you have stored in your barns? Maybe a little grain for bread. <i class="calibre5">Signore Panacci</i> says you are running out of room and the food is rotting.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He tossed the bone, all that was left of the chunk of meat, to the ground, complaining it was inferior, not a fit for a man like him, or would he feed it to his dogs, that he loved. He wiped with his sleeve, and I thought of grabbing the bone and running into the woods, but I feared this old bastard, mostly the pain he could put on my family, worse than the pain of hunger, that I have known. The sonofabitch.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I envy you,” he said, folding his hands like a priest. “This problem you think you have…hunger, it will make you a better man…stronger…maybe a survivor. But no, you will get no free food from me. No handouts. A handout will only make you lazy. Do you have any pride? Better you die and your whole family starve. Do not worry. If you are not meant to starve then you will not starve. If you are strong enough to survive, you will survive. I owe you this honesty and it will make you a better man.”  He took a small drink from his cup. </p>
<p class="calibre6">He waved at me to come closer. </p>
<p id="page_14" class="calibre6">“What did you think I would do? Just give you what you wanted? Let me explain the nature of things to you, so you will understand. I thought I did this years ago.” He put his cup down on the ground and cleared his throat. “It is simple, that even a peasant can understand. If you do starve, and it would be a shame since you and your family are nice people, as I recall, but it would on ly be because you are weaklings, <i class="calibre5">parassita</i>(parasites), and I cannot, by any law of nature or God, give you food. And I will tell you why.” He groaned and asked for help getting off the ground. A lifetime of hard work and constant worry about his <i class="calibre5">contadini</i> has taken its toll, he said. He relaxed against a tree, fanning himself with an old rag he dragged from his back pocket, while complaining on the heat, but admitting it was the best part of the day, because he could watch him men work(and they worked harder when he watched)while drinking fine wine.  He would gladly give me a cup, he said, but then everyone would want a cup and he would go broke.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you understand this word, <i class="calibre5">parrassita</i>?” he asked.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I repeat the word. “<i class="calibre5">Parrassita</i>? No, signuri, I am sorry. I do not.” He glared at me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am not surprised. Let me explain it to you.” He drank wine from his flask and licked the drippings from his lips. “The best is worth every penny you pay.” He cleared his throat.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “If you were born to be a slave, and we know a slave is born to work and suffer, then you know your life will be hell, and my friend, I am sorry to say it is the nature of things that cannot be changed. A ‘<i class="calibre5">parassita</i>,’  is vermin, like an insect to be crushed, or a  man who sucks the life from a better man who is not ‘<i class="calibre5">parassita</i> .’” He paused and cleared his throat. “Do you understand?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si,” I understand. We all understand,” and he smiled, and damned my soul to hell because I asked for his help.    </p>
<p id="page_15" class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Castello</i> was the <i class="calibre5">capu. </i>The <i class="calibre5">capu</i> is the boss; he is born to it, and his father and his father’s father were born to it, and it is the Law of the world, they say. Great men, rich men, inherit the right to live well and rule at their leisure, and we have no choice but to obey, as it is the nature of things and the law of God declared by the law and the Church. Everyone knows it. The politicians know it, as do the priests of the Church and God knows it, because He created the way, and it will always be, and if it was meant to be any other way, then it would not be this way. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The will of God,” Castello said, “or else how could it be? Maybe it is not right or fair, as you see it, but it <i class="calibre5">is</i> the will of God.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Did this happen? I am certain it did, but maybe not. The goddam pills.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Castello </i>was a powerful man, but hated, and who had the guts to say it to his face? My father never said it, but my grandfather said it with no shame, or regret.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Nonno</i> come early to the piazza, before the sun came up, to greet the men who would wait on Castello, who chose the men to work, who would not complain about the day’s pay, since he decided how long the day would be. Nonno said it many times, that Sicilia would be heaven, if the <i class="calibre5">capu’s</i> were dead, all of them. When he was young and vigorous, he was careful, preaching only when the <i class="calibre5">Carabinieri</i> were somewhere else, not to be seen a rebellious man, a <i class="calibre5">piantagrane, </i>a troublemaker. He stood on an old wooden bench and preached revolution, his message always the same, “take back what these bastards have taken from us.” The men listened, if the weather was good, and there was no good game of briscola to watch, otherwise he was ignored. He preached what he believed, but alone and weak, and because of this he never crossed swords with Castello, who paid him no mind. Only God has the power to destroy these men, and He is with them, so they say. I believe this to be true.   </p>
<p id="page_16" class="calibre6">When I think back to the fields, where I spent my life, and Castello, and the Island, I wonder if what I think is real, or a dream? When I am sleeping, I think, am I awake?  When I think I am awake, am I sleeping? This confusion I blame on the god damned pills, but sometimes  I think I am already dead, and this is how it is to be dead. I wake screaming and sweating, or I believe I am awake, maybe not. If I am already dead and stinking, so be it.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I blame the pills.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">This one day I decided I would leave after they serve me breakfast, but I felt a chill on my arms, and when I turn to the door he was there, but I never heard him coming, or where he came from, because he is smart and educated and wears women’s shoes, with soft rubber soles. “Hello,” he says. Never ‘good morning, how are you today,’ and he sits and crosses his legs, and I admit he sits too much like a woman to suit me, but he was a big man, otherwise manly looking, and he wore no beard(that was good). He always tapped a pencil against the side of his clipboard, and the sound of it, tap, tap, tap, near drove me crazy.  He cleared his throat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Mister, uh.” He looked at the paper. “Mr. Sporceeno. You look, uh, better today…let me get right to the report.” He feels for his watch, rolling back the sleeve of his white coat.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m sorry to say it, but, uh,” he scratched at his nose, “your lungs are very bad.”  He stopped. His head went back, slow, like a pistol being cocked; then the shot, and his body shook with as good a sneeze as I have seen.  He turned away from me, and I will not swear to this, but I believe he wiped on the sleeve of that white coat.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This goddamned…this cold…it’s a curse,” he said, and sneezed again, and I felt his spray across my bare arm.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Excuse me,” he said, embarrassed. “Uh, what was I saying.? Yes, your lungs are in very bad shape and your kidney, it’s probably going to fail. I am sorry to give you this bad news.” He pulled a small cloth from his pocket and wiped his glasses clean, held them to the light and wiped again.   </p>
<p id="page_17" class="calibre6">“You are, well, I want to be honest. If your condition cannot be stabilized, you may be terminal if the one kidney you have left fails. I’m sorry.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He picked at a red sore on his face and cleared his throat and apologized. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The x-rays show tumors. Small tumors. nonetheless, they are in your lungs, but may have spread to your legs. This is why breathing is difficult and walking is painful for you.” He was quiet for a time, his hands folded neatly across the clipboard on his lap. He looked at his watch, twice within a few seconds, and I understood the sign, that my time with him was up and he was thinking on the next poor bastard. He leaned and touched my arm and cleared his throat, as if he had more bad news to tell.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you think <i class="calibre5">Mr. Sporceeni</i>?” He paused and looked around the room.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I caught his eyes. “About what?” I ask.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What I have been saying…my diagnosis…your condition?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You say I am finished? Is that what you mean?” He patted my arm.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Good. The language difference. I am never sure if you understand me. You take bad news very well. Your background helps.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Background?  What does it mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, never mind, it’s not important. In any case you have made this talk easy for me. I thank you for that.” He sneezed again, not as hard as the first time, but he was still embarrassed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“God help me. This cold…it will kill me, like a dog.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">*<i class="calibre5">Quando</i>?” I ask. He was confused by the word, quando? When?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Excuse me, Mr. Sparc… I don’t understand.” </p>
<p id="page_18" class="calibre6">“I am sorry, <i class="calibre5">dutturi</i>, but when I am nervous…like now…I speak Sicilianu.”  I stare at his face. He is younger than me, but he could be my older brother. I take a deep breath.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How long?” I ask. There are things to do. I hoped he would give me enough time. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How long?  Is that what you said?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I nod. “<i class="calibre5">Si</i>. How long?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, its, uh, hard to say. A few months, maybe six, maybe a year. It depends on how fast the small tumors become big tumors and spread. You are a strong man. Maybe a few years, but I don’t think that long. I had a patient who lived for three years with these tumors. Small tumors, but he was…well, younger than you are. These things can be very aggressive. Unpredictable. Only weeks, maybe. I can’t say with certainty. But never despair. There is a treatment for this condition.  Expensive. But it may give you more time.  And we can make you comfortable. Every man is different. I cannot …”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I hear ‘every man is different,’ but nothing after this wisdom. I keep watching his mouth move, and I nod respectfully. At first, I saw him only as my executioner, but it was a crap shoot, hand of <i class="calibre5">briscola</i>, no more. When he stopped talking, clipboard in hand, he picked up his pencil that fell to the floor, and pointed his right foot to the door, getting ready his retreat, wishing his feet had wheels, I bet.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you have any questions before I leave?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Si. Why me, and not you?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. no questions, dutturi. Maybe my son will have questions.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course. Have him call my office to make an appointment.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">How smooth he was, the way he gave me the bad news, like it was nothing, a bump in the road, not the end of me. ‘Never despair,’ he says, with no smile, a dead face. He said the words tough, not soft like a woman, because women care more. If I could be there when his time comes, to see him kick and hear him scream, begging for one more day, one more hour, one more minute, I would say, ‘never despair, <i class="calibre5">dutturi</i>. There are things we can do.’     </p>
<p id="page_19" class="calibre6">A month of worthless treatments, but I pay because I do not want to die. All I ask, when the times comes, give me one more day. <i class="calibre5">Sempre domani.</i> Tomorrow is always better than today, but today I am sicker than yesterday (the bill comes Friday with breakfast, under the plate of eggs).  I refuse to complain, or be the annoying man, as I have always hated annoying people and complainers and men not content with what they have, not satisfied with the way things are. Somewhere in the heavens I was crossed with a mule, of this I am certain, but I have never told it that way, for fear of insulting mama and papa. It was a joke, nothing more, but I admit being well trained by the circumstances of my life. Drag it over there and drag it back and keep your goddamned mouth shut. Are you complaining, cavone?  I will slap that scowl off your face. Be strong. Never complain. It is strength, and the back breaking labor that makes you happy. It is not necessary to believe what you are trained to believe; but never complain. Just do it.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">These pills they serve me, all colors; green, red and blue and white. I take them, no questions, because in a while, I will float, like a feather. They say you get used to this feeling and like it. Women like it. I did not at first, but I have learned to like it. A yellow pill to sleep, a white pill to wake up and the red pill that’s helps me piss in the tube, and a blue one, so I do not piss too much in the tube.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I asked one day, though not complaining. “Is there a pill for the sweats…at night?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Night sweats? Certainly. Just ask,” they say. “Why haven’t you asked…that’s why we are here.”  </p>
<p id="page_20" class="calibre6">The green pill works, when it works, dries me out and cracks my skin and my mouth bleeds when I eat. Is there a pill for nightmares? I take what they offer, no questions asked, just rid me of this little bastard who bumps my bed in the night and speaks to me, scaring me to death, but I have never seen him, only the whites of his fucking eyes dancing around a black room.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Antonino Sparacino</i>(he calls me by name). I am waiting patiently,” this little bastard says, then he makes a wicked laugh. “But not forever. I will not wait forever. You are a selfish man, Antonino. I have others to see; better men than you. I do not have all night to do my.” He laughs and I cower like a beat dog, sweating like a pig. “Women, too,” he says, laughing. “I never forget the women, but children are the best, as they cause the greatest grief and pain for the greatest number, and this is what I am about.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Then he disappears, <i class="calibre5">andato</i>, he is gone. What is his name, can you tell me this, and why am I freezing when the room is like a furnace? Where is the sense in it?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I have been here before, a few years back, Carmela says, and she is never wrong.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">This same doctor, this <i class="calibre5">cavone, </i>took out a kidney he said was “diseased,” no good anymore. “It has to go, but do not despair.” He lifted a finger to the front of his nose, “You only need one kidney. I will fix this, and you will be fine, I guarantee it. Trust me.”  When it was over, how pleased he was with the fine work he did that day. So pleased, he said it again. “You only need one, that’s all, and the one you have left is perfect. You will live to be a hundred years old…a hundred years old.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">A hundred years. ‘<i class="calibre5">Centu anni’</i> is how you say it where I come from.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A hundred years, he says, but I am failing. Who makes good the thirty years I am owed?  </p>
<p id="page_21" class="calibre6">The nights are long, and I fear them, like a child. In the morning it is not so bad, there is good light from the window, and there are people, and food; two eggs and bread (American bread) and something they swear is oatmeal, but it is not bad if I bury it in salt. The nurses clean me, like a mother cleans a baby, but for me it is not a good thing; it shames me, like I have committed some crime. If the hose leaked during the night, they change the bedding and I am surprised they smile, but how can they like it, or do they hate me for it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I pass the daylight hours staring at the <i class="calibre5">Irish Lace</i> hanging from the ceiling light and the breeze through the open door makes them flutter and dance around. The lace is longer every day and I hope to be here when they fall from their own weight. Watching dust is how I pass the day.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Where is he? He knows I want to see him, but I will understand if he does not come. What young man wants to smell the stink of death in the air. There is nothing here, nothing new, but old life. There is new life in Memorial, down the street, but not here.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> I paid no attention when I hear the door open, figuring it to be some nurse with a pill, or a needle, and she will say, “it won’t hurt at all.”  Do I need this shit, I ask Carmela, who prays to *<i class="calibre5">Sant’Agata</i>, and she tells me <i class="calibre5">Sant’ Agata</i> needs time to arrange a good miracle? <i class="calibre5">Sant’Agata</i> goes to <i class="calibre5">Santo Pietro</i>, and <i class="calibre5">Santo Pietro</i> sits at the right hand of God, with His ear. This takes time, she says. “Maybe if you prayed with me, but I have never seen you pray.” I shake my head. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Pray? I have no use for it because I am an honest man.” She smiles.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are a good man,” she says, “but you would be a better man is you prayed with me </p>
<p class="calibre6">She comes here every day, this beautiful woman, and I wonder, how can I be a sinner, if Carmela, who is a saint herself, has been with me all these years? She stays until I am asleep and when I wake, she is gone, but now I feel a stirring at the side of my bed.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Nonno</i>? Are you awake? Its Michael.”  </p>
<p id="page_22" class="calibre6">Michele? Not Carmela?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He has come to see me, like I asked, or do I dream it, or is everything a dream? I force a look to my right. It is <i class="calibre5">Michele</i>, like he says. When I fell off, I was talking to Carmela, I think, and watching the lace, and she was watching a bird on the sill flapping its wings in the snow.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I envy him. A bird, a free bird not caged.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Michele</i>, <i class="calibre5">mio nipotu</i>. Come in. <i class="calibre5">Tu siedi</i>. Sit down.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I am glad he is here, but surprised, he tells his father he is afraid he will throw up on the floor and cause me embarrassment. Barely in the door, already his face is grey, like mine, but I am still happy he is here.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Vienne Qua</i>,” I say. He smiles.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Papa said you wanted to see me. I was coming Sunday after church, but papa said I should come today...are you allright? Papa said you…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Grazie</i>, <i class="calibre5">Michele</i>. <i class="calibre5">Si</i>. I am glad you came.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I almost missed the bus. How are you feeling today? Papa said…?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I feel good, <i class="calibre5">Michele. </i>Better than yesterday. <i class="calibre5">Grazie</i> for asking.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">The truth, my pain is like I imagine the pain of hell to be if there is a hell. My legs are swollen, numb from knees to the floor. I piss through a god damned tube somewhere near the <i class="calibre5">coglioni</i>. He is sixteen years old; a boy in America, but a man in Sicilia, who would do a man’s work to survive and feed a family. Maybe he is seventeen.<i class="calibre5"> Si</i>, seventeen. <i class="calibre5">Certo</i>. I am sure of it. He is already taller than his father, Orazio, my oldest (he is forty-three, as I recall, or forty-two, but Carmela will know). He is the first grandchild on both sides, and I promised my son I would be there when he is born. It was a long walk to the bus stop from the yards; two transfers, but I made it there like I said. His other grandfather, a good man, but a lesser man (not Sicilianu) was not there or was his wife there. They come up at night when it was over, and his wife, the mother of the mother, believed she deserved a special place, and said as much when she made her entrance. Do this, do that, she says nasty to the nurses, and the big nurse says, she would throw us all out if the mother interfered again.    </p>
<p id="page_23" class="calibre6">But I was there, on time, like a good watch, and when he was born, I was the first grandfather he saw. <i class="calibre5">*Gino Moro</i>, a good neighbor, come to find me at the engine house, and said they brought my daughter-in-law to the hospital. The buses were slow and crowded and hot, like hell.  I prayed some in those days, and I prayed I would be there before he was born, to welcome him (I knew he would be a boy, I would have it no other way). I was early by a good ten minutes, and on his part, this was his show of respect for his grandfather, that he waited for me before leaving a good place for this place. When I see him for the first time, he was all Sicilian eyes, and I think to myself, how beautiful he is, and they will call him <i class="calibre5">Antonino</i>, after me, and I will watch him grow and help him along the way, if I am able, and things will be better for him and they will not run him out like they run me out, those bastards. Was I insulted when my daughter-in-law named him Michael (not even Michele), after her father, *<i class="calibre5">Michele Petrulli,</i> who likes to call himself <i class="calibre5">Big Mike</i>, as if he is Americano, or <i class="calibre5">Irlandese</i>? I refuse and will not call him  “Michael,” as it is Irish and the boy is not Irish,  <i class="calibre5">Sicilianu</i> and some <i class="calibre5">Calibraise. </i>But no <i class="calibre5">Irish</i>. My son apologized for this ‘slight’ he calls it, blaming his wife; she did not like the name ‘<i class="calibre5">Antonino</i>,’ as it is too foreign for an American man. The truth is she does not like me(her people are Calabrese and I made jokes about them, that I now regret, but the <i class="calibre5">Calabrese</i> have always been an easy laugh. I swallowed her shit and suffered this disrespect in silence, and I smile when men ask why he is <i class="calibre5">Michael</i> and not <i class="calibre5">Antonino</i>.  I say, “there are already too many Antonino’s in the world.” Friends laugh at my joke, out of respect for me, but I will wear this shame on my sleeve, forever.  </p>
<p id="page_24" class="calibre6">Everyone knows my son to be a fine man, but he has no <i class="calibre5">coglioni</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre6">On the good holidays, Christmas, Easter, on his birthday, I take <i class="calibre5">Michele </i>aside and slip him a five-dollar bill; more than I give the rest, but he the oldest and deserves this respect, no matter he carries another man’s name. He changes by the day and seems more a man each time I see him.  He has my brother’s eyes, *<i class="calibre5">Salvatore</i>, the boy I left behind to die, because I am weak, and a man who cannot tell the truth. My memory of him is pain, that I deserve. He was a boy cursed from birth, born with the gentlest nature, different from the <i class="calibre5">cavones</i> who call themselves ‘men.’ He was quiet and sensitive, respectful of all living things, and I understand that in this world these qualities are best in a woman. He was persecuted by men who think men should be violent and respectful of nothing. They laughed at him, beat him when they could, with the least excuse, and felt proud of it, and bragged to the village they were better men.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">When the Great War came, they said he must fight, and do his duty to God and the King, but he refused, asking why he should kill men he did not know, who had not hurt him or his family. He was hated, because he refused to fight, while the rest obeyed, like sheep. The army  sent four armed men to run down this frail and sickly boy. I was not a witness to this <i class="calibre5">infamia</i>, thank God, because I was in America, but men whose word I trust said he went hard, kicking and screaming, vowing not to fight at the whim of other men. They jailed him with the rats and vermin, for months, to wear him down. The guards beat him for no reason, cowards who saved themselves from the front because they would torture the defenseless without remorse(the best torturers I have been told). In the end they broke him, of course. He surrendered. Did he have a choice? Was he a free man? His war ended the day he escaped the trench in a canvas bag, a single shot having done him in, or a well-placed mortar round, or a bayonet; these are the stories, and we are free to choose which ever liked the best. They threw him onto a pile with other men who met the same fate, and sooner or later, the enemy would fire a barrage where the corpses were heaped, to be certain they were all dead, not pretending to be dead, as cowardly men were known to do. Salvatore is buried somewhere in the North, or maybe near the sea, and I believe my mother and father  never saw his grave, or have I. The story of his death came in a letter to the priest, who brought it to my family, and my mother wept and cursed, and my father stared at the wall. When I received the letter from *<i class="calibre5">Patri Carmine</i>, our priest in Sicilia, did I cry? I did not cry, but more, I refused to cry. I have not cried to this day. Patri was a priest, a man of God, but also a common man, like all the rest. Patri said *<i class="calibre5">Salvatore</i> a hero, said I should come back home, to <i class="calibre5">Sicilia,</i> for his memorial, when he would be honored for his sacrifice. I did not go home because there was no money for passage, and the big boss said I would have no job when I returned. What would I say to my family? To Papa? I hear the bullshit about ‘hero,’ but I prayed he was no hero, that he did not die to save the willing, eager men who were there because the <i class="calibre5">capu</i> said the fight was right, and their life had no value beyond war. A Captain, or some other important man, who knew nothing of Salvatore, sent a  letter because it was his job and he was paid to do it, as Salvatore was paid to die.       </p>
<p id="page_25" class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">“Your son, Salvatore Sparacino, died bravely in battle, while advancing on the enemy, </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">defending his family and Country and King. It is my honor to call him one of “I cadutti,” </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">the fallen. His name will be carved on a marble wall in the piazza, as a tribute to the </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">heroes of your village, and the bells of the Church will toll nine times in his honor.” </i></p>
<p id="page_26" class="calibre6">I say this to these bastards, who love their guns and grenades and mortars, and worship the good fight, and what they call bravery and honor, and the men who write the letters, and build walls of honor in the piazzas, that when I prayed, I pray you all rot in hell.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I blame them, all these bastards, but I blame myself.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He was a boy when I left Sicilia, maybe ten, eleven. but old enough to be angry our family was in a bad way, and that I was leaving. I begged him, walk with me to the top of the mountain road, but he turned away. If we embraced that day, I have no memory of it, but I do not believe we did. A month to the day before I left, I picked firewood with papa in the woods belonging to *<i class="calibre5">signuri Basile. </i>Papa was quiet, no jokes, none of the stories he always told, or did he bring his small flask of wine, that he always carried, like a priest carries his crucifix. Papa took me by the arm, and we faced each other; his voice was weak, not thundering like always. I had never seen him so nervous.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“These woods are near played out,” I said, to break the silence; he nodded, and broke off a small branch from a dead tree, throwing it aside. He was looking at the ground, as he cleared his throat, then stared me straight in the eye, never flinching, or looking away., but he was nervous, as I could see and sweating like a work mule. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Take your brother away from here…bring him to America.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He waited, all nervous like an impatient man, but I said nothing.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He leaned closer to me. “What do you say?” I cleared my throat, and I suppose it meant to him that I would not bring Salvatore with me.  He seemed angry.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He will not go with me, papa. He says I am abandoning the family.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He will do what I say. But never tell your mother I asked. <i class="calibre5">Capisce</i>?”  </p>
<p id="page_27" class="calibre6">“Si. <i class="calibre5">Capisco. </i>But Santo and Luca will not have him along…I have asked. It is too dangerous to bring a boy, they say.” Papa stared into the black woods.  He shook his head, hard, to show his disgust with me, like many times before.  He spit in the bush and turns to me and stared with his fiery green eyes.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Never trust your life to weak men, like Luca. He is a selfish, with no feeling. Little better than a criminal himself. But Santo is family. I expected better from him.” He spit again. “I was hoping. Maybe if you went with better men?” He sighed and kicked a piece of half rotted wood into the ditch. “Never mind what I say. I am getting old. I forget that most men never do any good. When I dream at night, I dream that the worst will happen if you leave Salvatore behind. What is here for him? You know him and what he will be. His life will be short with too much pain.” I thought about what he said.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">What can happen to my brother? Nothing. He is young and strong. In a few years, he will be a man; his own man. I am certain of it. Papa tried to bully me with his own dreams. He pointed his finger at my face, and I backed away. “But I will tell you this, you will regret the day you left him behind.” That was the last said of it that night. I picked as much wood as I could carry and fetched the piece papa threw in the ditch, but it was not enough, and that night, water in the tin cup was frozen solid in the morning, and it never happened before. The truth, I did not want the bother of a boy, not even my brother, my own flesh and blood. Even a lesser man would have done more for a dog, but in the back of my mind I was coming back as soon as I saved money to buy my own land, and we would all be landowners and maybe capu’s. I said this so many times, I believed it to be true. But there was the part of me who did not want to come back. What could be worse than disease and famine and dirty water, no work and the rotten bosses. I hoped I loved America. This was really my plan, not to come home, but to call for my family and they would come, but I knew mama and papa would never leave, and my brother Paolo would do what suits him, and when my sisters married, their men would make the decision, but I would ask papa to send Salvatore and I would meet him at the boat, and we would be brothers again. Some years later came the Great War, and they took my brothers, <i class="calibre5">Paolo</i> and <i class="calibre5">Salvatore</i> into the army. <i class="calibre5">Paolo</i> drove a wagon, with horses, behind the lines in <i class="calibre5">Francia, </i>suffering not a scratch and he said “it was not so bad,” but <i class="calibre5">Salvatore </i>was murdered dead by the Austrians, or Germans, or the Russians, on a wasteland with no name. Am I to blame he died? Did I fire the weapon that put him down, or load the shell into the tube, that ripped him apart after he was dead? The priest preaches about heaven and hell, the other side. If there is such a place and we meet, will my brother say I handed his executioner the sword?  </p>
<p id="page_28" class="calibre6">Mama and papa visit me in the night and remind me of the evil I did to Salvatore.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">They are the fine people I loved when they were alive, and now I love them more and respect their memory, but not the visits in the night and the terror they bring. But what do you say to the dead? They are thin and weak, far worse than the day I left home, but out of respect I say how good they look. Mama sits at the edge of my bed, rubbing my forehead., and smiles when I ask, is she wearing a new dress? “No,” she replies, “it is old like me.” I hug her hard, but wishing they would leave and not come back.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are my favorite,” mama says, “but never tell your brothers and sisters.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I take her hand, twisted from arthritis and old age.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You were a fine mother,” I say, and she would kiss my check.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How are they treating you?” she always asks. “If you die…it is not so bad.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Papa worries on the bill. “How will you pay?” he wants to know. “<i class="calibre5">I soldi</i> is everything with these bastards. Watch them, like an eagle, because they will cheat you if they can,” and he repeats the many times he was cheated in his life, who cheated him, and how he tried to cheat them back, but he was too good a man.    </p>
<p id="page_29" class="calibre6">I tell mama and papa about my children, proudly naming them in the order they were born. Mama laughs, says I am a better man than most. I say Carmela, my wife, is in good health. I tell them because they will not ask. They like her, yes, she is the is mother to their grandchildren, but not blood. Every night they come I make the same mistake, and say my oldest grandchild, <i class="calibre5">Michele</i>, favors <i class="calibre5">Salvatore </i>in his fine looks. Mama cries, she curses the men who murdered<i class="calibre5"> Salvatore. </i>Then she turns on me, with fire eyes.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And you, you said you would come back.” She curses and I weep like a child.  “When I was sick, you never came home.” I take her hand, but she pulls away.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I was here, in America, thousands of miles away. What could I do?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I was dying…I begged you to come. I prayed, but you ignored me…your own mother.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I raise my voice. “I did not know you were dying until you were dead and buried.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Papa slaps my face, hard. “Show respect for your mother,” he says. “I demand it.” He steps closer to me and looks straight into my eyes; I try to look away, but he grabs my face with both hands.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Never think I forget you left your brother to die. I know you lied to me.” He reaches for his hat from the edge of my bed. “It is time to leave,” he says, staring off at the bare wall, and I believe it is because he cannot stand to look at me, his oldest son.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Mama hugs me, kisses my forehead.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What is tomorrow?” papa asks. “Is it giovedi? Si, giovedi…we come back tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Mama shakes her head. “Not on <i class="calibre5">giovedi. Giovedi</i> is market day.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. <i class="calibre5">Giovedi</i> is market day,” he says. “Maybe venerdi….si, venerdi. The next day.” </p>
<p id="page_30" class="calibre6">They walk into the darkness of my room and disappear.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Always after they leave, I remember the letters.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The night storm was over. It came from the north and worse than most storms; drifts four, five feet high, six feet in the driveway, but I had no car, I never learned to drive, so what was the difference? I never understood the purpose of snow, and I thought many times about what God means by a storm and why does He send it? Me, I suffer enough for my sins without it. Our mailman, *<i class="calibre5">Signuri Henry Bannon</i> was late, like always, but when I say it, he shows at the front door, complaining the sidewalk is not shoveled; the neighborhood no longer shows him this courtesy, like the old days. He hands me two letters from his leather pouch. “From <i class="calibre5">home</i>,” he said, not sure where I called home, as he could not understand the return address, “poorly written, in a foreign language.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tell them they should write in English,” he said. “English.” I shake my head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sicilianu. “It is Sicilianu. My language.” He nodded, though I am certain it meant nothing to him. <i class="calibre5">Signuri Bannon</i> was not an old man, but he acted like an old man, and I am not certain he enjoyed the company of immigrants to “his” country, always swearing he had nothing against “you people.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I get a letter from Sicilia, maybe every six or seven months, but none so far this year. It has been years since two letters in one year, and never two on the same day, but I was glad to have them, even if the news is bad and the news is always bad. The last letter announced the death of my cousin *<i class="calibre5">Giacomo’s</i> daughter, “who died a horrible death from some godforsaken disease that spread through the village, like wind.” Ten dead, near ten, but she was the youngest, born after I left for America. They called her *Maria, named for his mother; a fine woman, who worked like ten men, though she limped from the day she could walk. That letter asked we pray for the people in the village, and maybe send a few lire, as times were bad, and not getting better. I always sent what I could, not much, and only if the cause was good and I believed they were <i class="calibre5">famiglia </i>who would do it for me. Giacomo was a cousin on my mother’s side.  </p>
<p id="page_31" class="calibre6">“Come in, <i class="calibre5">Signuri Martin, </i>and get warm.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Call me ‘Hank,’” he always says.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">‘Hank?’ I would not call a dog ‘Hank.’  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He shook his coat and a bushel of snow fell to the floor, melting fast, leaving puddles. I throw down rags and pushed the water around with my foot, hoping it would dry before Carmela came home.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Carmela is cleaning the Church, or we both would catch hell for this mess,” I say.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your lovely wife, Carmela. How is she?” he asked, shaking the last of the snow from his cap onto the floor, like some <i class="calibre5">stunado</i>. I give him a dirty look, but he smiled. A <i class="calibre5">stunado</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre6">He moved close and whispered, though the house was empty except for the two of us.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Say, Mr. Sparacino, do you have a little wine?” he asks, like a bold man. “I need to thaw out…the cold…the drifts. I am not young man anymore.” He laughed and slapped my back. “You know what I mean.” He drinks two full glasses of my good wine, not my best wine I saved for family, but decent wine, aged in the old barrel for, maybe, two months. Not the best. He brings the glass to his nose and takes a deep breath and smiles, as if enjoying the smell of a good cigar, or a flower, like a red rose. I love the word “roses,” and the sound when I say it.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your wine, it’s the best on my route.” He laughs as he points across the street. </p>
<p class="calibre7">“*<i class="calibre5">Guarini</i>, your neighbor. His wine is sour, like vinegar…never tell him I said so.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded. “Si, you are correct. Guarini buys his grapes. He refuses to grow his own.” </p>
<p id="page_32" class="calibre6">“You <i class="calibre5">Italians</i> (eyetalians, he says) know how to live. But this wine, I never had this wine,  isn’t it right?”  He winked and toasted me with an empty glass I did not refill. I covered my eyes.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I see nothing. <i class="calibre5">Non vedo nulla</i>” is what we say in the “old country.” I learned to call <i class="calibre5">Sicilia</i> “the old country.” Americani, they feel better about us when we do. “The old country.” I know now I begged a lot back and then and today I am ashamed for it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">There was a gold cross on each of the envelopes, in the corner, and I knew the letters come from <i class="calibre5">Patri Carmine</i>, who always wrote the same thing; “the Church is empty, the village is deserted. When are coming home?” I am always surprised he was still alive and a priest, after all these years.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">*Our reader, <i class="calibre5">Francesco Longo</i>, was a good friend. I say ‘was’ because he is gone, <i class="calibre5">morte</i>, some years ago, but I think about him often; he was like my brother, and my family remembers him this way, and his memory is respected in my home. He lived next door and when needed he read letters and wrote letters, when we needed letters written. He could write in Italiano, Siciliano, and English; an educated man, like my friend, the teacher, *<i class="calibre5">Enzo Baneri</i>(long since gone). Francesco worked with me for years, and he enjoyed his wine (the <i class="calibre5">americani</i> on the railroad called him ‘a drunk’), but sober he had no accent when he spoke English; drunk he spoke <i class="calibre5">Sicilianu</i>, as he thought English and Italian, were the language of barbarians. Si.  He was an educated man, schooled in <i class="calibre5">Sicilia</i>, in <i class="calibre5">Palermu</i>, but he ended up a nobody, like me, swinging a pick for a few cents an hour. I never knew why he left Sicilia, or did he talk about the family he left behind, if there was family. His wife, <i class="calibre5">Teresa Moritti</i>, never spoke with the neighborhood woman, spending her days rocking on the front porch when the weather was good, stepping off only to sweep the walk, maybe three or four times a day. *<i class="calibre5">Carmela</i> believed *<i class="calibre5">Teresa</i> was dull witted; frail and thin, like an ax handle, she had no teeth, or did she have children, and I do not believe she was married to Francesco. Was it my business?  </p>
<p id="page_33" class="calibre6">He would not answer to any name but Francesco, not even ‘Frank” when called by the Irishman *<i class="calibre5">Mike Leary</i>, who was our section boss. Francesco never spoke ill of any man, as I recall, and in the end, he hung on to his life for better than a year, finally letting go on Christmas day. They say he died of bad lungs, from dust in the Sicilian sulphur mines, and soot from coal mines, somewhere in Penasoolvanea, where he worked before he came to the railroad. Whenever I needed him, I send my daughter, Rosa, next door; this time to say there were two letters and could he come fast. “Can you help us?” she asked, and when he came, he would knock on the back door and walked in; always welcome, like a brother or a good friend. He always thanked me when I poured him a small glass of my best wine(without asking), and a shot of whiskey, that he drank in one breath and sipped the wine. This time he took another whiskey. “I hope the goddamned ice and snow does not kill you vines, he said. “Thank God,” he said, making the sign of the cross, “there is none of this shit back home.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This is home,” I said. He nodded, and sadly, as I could tell. He pulled out the chair at the head of the table and put on a pair of worn reading glasses (a small crack in one lens) and cleared his throat and waited for me to pir him another wine. He read the first line of the first letter.     </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">“Ciao Antonino. Your mother, *Giovanna Faraone, is gravely ill.  </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">On hearing this my knees went weak, and I grabbed for Carmela hand. I say to Francesco, who was sweating, “say it in your own words.” He looked down at the letter, then stared into my eyes and cleared his throat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">“She begs you come home and comfort her, before she passes into God’s hands.”  </i></p>
<p id="page_34" class="calibre6">“Go home,” Francesco said. “Your mother is…she is dying.”  Patri Carmine said she was sick from some vicious disease passing through the village and she refused to stay in bed, because many were sick and needed her help.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I think, ‘she will survive.’ She has been near death before, with the cholera and the smallpox, not to say she bore five children, that alone would kill half the women in the village. I remember this clearly; I never saw her in bed past daylight.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Francesco picked up the second letter, his hands trembling like an old man’s hands, He coughed as he opened it. I sat quietly, my hands flat on my knees; my children there to comfort me, and Carmela held my hand, looking at me with love and kindness and respect.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your mother is a strong woman,” she said, and we smiled together.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Francesco asked, “<i class="calibre5">Mappina, per favore</i>,” and Carmela waved to *<i class="calibre5">Rosa</i>, who brought a clean towel; he thanked her, wiping the sweat from his neck and forehead. He read the first words of the second letter, at first to himself (his lips never moved, the sign of an educated man).  He stopped and stared at me for a second and I see the sympathy in his eyes, and maybe a tear.  I knew mama was dead, gone forever. I showed no emotion, as it is not a manly thing. I rose slowly, excused myself and walked to the arbor behind the house. Near buried in the snow, below the bare vines, was an old wooden bench, where I sat and wept like a lost child, and told her I was sorry, as if she could hear me or forgive me.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Mama was dead and buried a month when the letters came.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">My worry was papa, now alone, without his wife of fifty years.  Six months later, in Agustu, he was in the Piazza with *<i class="calibre5">Signuri Marzini</i>, his friend of sixty years, who brought his best wine for the night, and two crystal glasses, a gift from his wife, who was dead from dirty water and the fever. The two friends sat on a wooden bench made by Signuri Marzini’s father years before, drinking wine and watching a good game of briscola, listening to the men lie about the women they had known.  </p>
<p id="page_35" class="calibre6">Papa asked, could he have more wine, half a glass, and his friend, Signuri Marzini poured him a glass and another for himself. <i class="calibre5">Salutѐ</i>,” they said together, raising their glasses to the bell tower of the <i class="calibre5">Chiesa di Sant’Agata</i>. They tell me papas his face went white, like chalk; he moaned and turned away and held his chest, falling gracefully to the wet cobblestones; always a man of dignity, even in death. Signuri Marzini panicked, and went to papa, but papa refused his hand, as he believed a man should not ask for help, and it was too late.     </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “It will pass,” papa said, apologizing, like a gracious man, for the wine he spilt, and Signuri Marzini’s fine crystal glass that shattered on the stones. Papa lay there and said a prayer, and the women cried, and everyone said he was a good man. He died where he fell, in the place his father preached to the <i class="calibre5">contadini</i>, who would listen unless there was a game of briscola to watch, or the weather was bad, and they all went home. Papa was buried next to mama in their plot on the hillside; a small piece of ground that was all they ever owned.  </p>
