    <h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px; font-style: italic;">The Cattle Sale on the Boat</h1>

    <p>We knew it, that <em>Giacomo Restunni</em> was a great man. Back on the boat he warned us, “Stand like a man. Never droop your body, or act like an ape,” and he bent over and walked and stared at the floor to show what he meant. “If you stoop, like a <em>scimmie</em> (an ape), they will treat you like an ape,” and we laughed, but he scolded like children. “Never look them in the eye, refuse to cower like a whipped dog, and never tell the truth if a lie serves you better. Never cough or complain or mention aches and pains. “Fuck all aches and pains,” he shouted. They need us to work, to keep them rich, so we must be healthy, like good mules, so any weakness will not be tolerated, or will they take sick women or sick children. We are the cattle sale, and only the strong, or those who look strong, are allowed to stay.”</p>

    <p>This was fifty years ago, maybe more, but it is like yesterday in my head. Maybe it was, how do I know. These goddamn pills, I never know if today is today, or yesterday or I am talking about tomorrow, or last week, or I imagine I am talking and I am really asleep. This place I am in, maybe for the last time, is best for the dead, and the dead who are near dead, but not dead yet. They keep me alive, but are they killing me? I watch it all, things that happened in the past, on the wall at the end of my bed. It is like being at the <em>East</em> (a movie house), but with no popcorn. I have loved popcorn since I come here.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Time of Hunger (The Past)</h3>

    <p>My papa was a good man. The best. He taught me the prayer of the <em>contadini</em> (the peasants). He told me we were made by God to suffer. “We were born to hurt, to struggle, and to starve. It is what God wants. So we must be happy for God and accept his gifts.”</p>

    <p>I do not think God gave us <em>Signuri Castello</em> as a gift. He was a small man, like a boy, but with the voice of a man who owned the world. He was the runt, the smallest of the <em>capu's</em> (the bosses), but he was the worst. He had a face like a dried plum and little squinty eyes. He was too weak to be a fighter, too ugly to be a lady's man, so he used his brain to be a cruel man.</p>

    <p>We had all gathered in the market square. It was during the year of the worst hunger. <em>Salvatore</em>, my younger brother, was there with me. He was skinny, weak from the hunger, and sick with the fever that made his skin hot and his eyes yellow. We had lined up for food that the capu's would not give. Not yet. They would wait until we were desperate, and then they would give us rotten potatoes.</p>

    <p>Castello stood on a wooden box, wearing a fine wool suit. He was smiling, but it was a cruel smile.</p>

    <p>“What is this?” he shouted. “You are like <em>parassita</em> (parasites). Why are you not working?”</p>

    <p>My father, who was standing beside me, spoke up: “Signuri, we are starving. The children are crying, and we have nothing.”</p>

    <p>Castello laughed, a high, squeaky noise. “Starving? Nonsense. God gives you the strength to work. It is only the lazy men who starve.” He looked directly at me. “Young man, you are strong. You have a back like a mule. Why are you not grateful for your strength?”</p>

    <p>I said nothing. I only looked at the ground and wanted to run away. <em>I cowered</em>.</p>

    <p>Castello continued to rant, and my father asked him if he could spare a book for Salvatore, who loved to read.</p>

    <p>Castello’s face went cold. “A book? For a peasant? What is the value of it if all you do is pick beans and shovel shit? You will teach your son to think he is a <em>signuri</em> (a lord) who does not have to work.”</p>

    <p>Then he pointed at us all and delivered his reward, the piece of advice he believed was worth more than a wagon of wheat: <em>“Know your place and be happy in it.”</em></p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Guilt</h3>

    <p>That was the last time I saw my father, truly. Not long after, they called Salvatore to the army. He was sick, but the order came. I had money, a secret pile, enough for a ticket out. A ticket only for one.</p>

    <p>I ran. I ran from the fields, from Castello, and from the shame that I could not fight back. I promised my mother I would send for them. I promised Salvatore I would come back.</p>

    <p>When I was on the boat, my father sent a letter. It was written by <em>Signuri Marzini</em>, his friend. It said: <em>"You left your brother behind to die in the Great War. You handed his executioner the sword."</em></p>

    <p>I left behind to die, because I am weak. Salvatore was the braver man. He knew he was going to die, but he went anyway. He did not run like a coward, like me.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Father's Farewell</h3>

    <p>They tell me he was in the Piazza with <em>Signuri Marzini</em>, his friend of sixty years, who brought his best wine for the night, and two crystal glasses, a gift from his wife, who was dead from dirty water and the fever. The two friends sat on a wooden bench made by Signuri Marzini’s father years before, drinking wine and watching a good game of briscola, listening to the men lie about the women they had known.</p>

    <p>Papa asked, could he have more wine, half a glass, and his friend, Signuri Marzini poured him a glass and another for himself. “<em>Salutѐ</em>,” they said together, raising their glasses to the bell tower of the <em>Chiesa di Sant’Agata</em>. They tell me papa’s his face went white, like chalk; he moaned and turned away and held his chest, falling gracefully to the wet cobblestones; always a man of dignity, even in death. Signuri Marzini panicked, and went to papa, but papa refused his hand, as he believed a man should not ask for help, and it was too late.</p>

    <p>“It will pass,” papa said, apologizing, like a gracious man, for the wine he spilt, and Signuri Marzini’s fine crystal glass that shattered on the stones. Papa lay there and said a prayer, and the women cried, and everyone said he was a good man. He died where he fell, in the place his father preached to the contadini, who would listen unless there was a game of briscola to watch, or the weather was bad, and they all went home. Papa was buried next to mama in their plot on the hillside; a small piece of ground that was all they ever owned.</p>
