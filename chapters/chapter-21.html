<div class="chapter-body">

<p class="calibre4">We are three <i class="calibre5">Siciliani</i> men; together we do not have enough money to be called poor. Enzo has money, he says, but <i class="calibre5">solo un po',</i> only a little. He swore he would have loaned the <i class="calibre5">D’arrico’s</i> money in Napoli, back on the dock, but it was too late, and in truth I have not seen a lira from him. If he has it, like he says, is it dirty money, stolen from children in school, or from whores?     </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Patri Carmine</i> preaches trust in God. I make humble apologies to this holy man, but we are here, and <i class="calibre5">Patri</i> is there. I say trust the man who speaks with experience, like <i class="calibre5">Restunni</i>, who says never slouch, or tell the truth when a lie will serve you better, or tremble or stare away like a whipped dog. This makes sense to me. The <i class="calibre5">capu </i>(the old man) is done for, I believe, as he has not come back to the cabin, and this is final evidence he is dead.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">We see, but we do not see.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">We know, but we do not know, or if we know who really cares. </p>
<p class="calibre6">We seemed to agree the <i class="calibre5">capu</i> was probably a dead man.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo was the first to mention the capu’s poke, and it was agreed there were decisions to make as to the <i class="calibre5">disposition</i>(Enzo’s word) of his property. After all, on this boat were the closest to him since it was our belief, he never spoke to another passenger. Luca’s idea was to raid the old man’s valise; take everything, like birds stripping carrion from a carcass. What he suggested was plain and common thievery, and it did not set with me, but Santo thought it proper, as some payment on the <i class="calibre5">capu’s </i>debt for the miserable men he leaves behind. But what misery has he caused us, and to this we had no answer. My argument, plain and simple, was this, that we have no right or claim to his property, if there is any property of value, and that is that.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Leave it for these thieving sailors,” I said. “Or throw it overboard. It is nothing but blood money, and I want no part of it.” But on this we agreed, whatever he carried in his leather valise, that looked packed full, was of no value to him, if he was dead, and even alive he may have returned to claim it. After I said it, there seemed to be more enthusiasm for searching through the his valise. </p>
<p id="page_683" class="calibre6">Enzo nodded and curled his lip. “If he is not gone, then are we stealing a living man’s property? If he <i class="calibre5">is</i> gone, are we defiling the dead, if he is dead?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo wondered out loud.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then are we no better no better than Conte, himself?”  We agreed to what he said, but I thought it odd talk from a man with a past, and this angered me, his holy attitude, but I kept my complaint to myself, as this is what I do best. If I bet what I had in my pocket, maybe three, four, lira, the old man is dead, <i class="calibre5">è morto</i>, and Luca knows where the corpse is hidden, and the full story on how he died.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">This was Luca’s story, as much as he would admit.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I see them face off…I turned my head…they were gone.” In the end, our curiosity (or   greed) beat the high and moral talk I heard in the last two weeks.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The next day, the day before they said we would land and be in America, our curiosity was too much. It took hold of us and smothered everything we always thought was right. We  stayed back in the cabin until the last man left, figuring to plunder alone was best done among friends, away from nosey people who might not believe our intentions were good and honorable. Enzo said “plunder” was a poor word, as common thievery was not our motive, and “inspection,” is what we planned. Pure and simple. We agreed, of course. The <i class="calibre5">capu’s</i> property, in Enzo’s educated opinion, was not “booty,” or “spoils of war,” if there was a war, since we were not in it(except Luca, who called everything a war). Any item removed, inspected, but not replaced,  should be an item useful to all, like food, or drink, or anything else that could be properly divided among us. This was Enzo’s opinion, but in any case, he led the charge.  </p>
<p id="page_684" class="calibre6">“This, I admit, is a simple interpretation of a complicated legal principal. If this is booty, under the Laws of the Sea, it belongs to any man who killed him, if, in fact, he was killed. But we have no proof the old man is dead, and if he is dead, who murdered him, if he was murdered, and not dead from natural causes. Anyone who murdered him, because murder is an illegal act, has lost his claim to the booty.” </p>
<p class="calibre6"> There was silence. Santo was first to say it all sounded like bullshit, and everyone agreed, except Enzo, who finally weakened and saw it our way.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then our duty is to look and catalog and preserve,” he said. “Of all the men in the cabin, we knew him best.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Maybe we all talked two, three times, and we all hated him.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If we find worthless property, junk, or other <i class="calibre5">palline</i>(baubles), it is moot.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Moot?” I asked. “‘Moot’ is a word?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, <i class="calibre5">moot</i>.” <i class="calibre5">Discutibile</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo’s explanation was long and tiring, and to be honest, I did not understand much of it, or did my partners. “Plundering,” “Booty,” “Spoils of War.” Now “Moot.” He meant to confuse.  Luca complained that he heard enough of this and that, and on his own he pulled out the old man’s valise from under a pile of blankets, opened it wide, and searched through it, like a crazy man. “Junk,” he said. “<i class="calibre5">Giunca.</i>” Then, hidden in a sock at the bottom of the poke, he discovers a pair of fine leather gloves; thick, well crafted, nearly new; expensive. Maybe ten lire.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Deerskin,” he said. “I see gloves like this before. Feel this leather…like fine silk.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You have seen fine silk?” Enzo asked. </p>
<p id="page_685" class="calibre6">“Never. But I know silk is smooth, and fine silk must be the best.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Dress gloves,” Enzo said, looking directly at me.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“For women?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He laughed. “No, not women, my mountain friend…for special occasions.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">It is true. The gloves were fine quality, the leather was perfect, not a flaw, and stitched twice, three times along the fingers, good for a king, or a <i class="calibre5">capu</i>.  I held the gloves, then put them to my nose, and at that moment, I learned to love the smell of expensive leather, and nothing else would ever do again. They should belong to me, I thought, but I am no thief. I slipped the right glove over my hand and felt some something in the tip of the middle finger, a small locket, gold and ornate, at the end of a delicate chain. “Pure gold,” I thought. Enzo examined the locket, in better light by the door. “It is gold,” he said, “Solid and valuable. Very valuable.”  I closed my eyes, tight, and I saw plainly the  locket hanging around Carmela’s slender neck. If only this locket was mine to give, I knew who I would give it to. I finagled and it snapped open, and inside was the picture of a young man, head and shoulders, but it was clear he wore an army uniform and maybe an officer’s uniform. Odd thing, I expected a picture of the old man’s wife, or his daughter, if he had one, or his <i class="calibre5">gumar</i>. But not a man. I was shocked and taken back, to see a man’s head where woman’s head should be. Maybe it is a woman’s locket, and the little bastard stole it. Si, of course. No doubt in my mind, the locket was plainly stolen.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca admired the piece, I could see, </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Keep it,” he said. “You have earned it and it will look good on Carmela’s neck.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Earned it? How have I earned it?” I folded the chain around the locket and pushed it back into the middle finger of the right glove. “I would not give Carmela stolen property, or anything I did not honestly gain, and never from a dead man’s poke.”   </p>
<p id="page_686" class="calibre6">Luca laughs. “A dead man’s poke, is that what you worry about.? You are a choir boy.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He dumped the rest on the floor and went through it, like a wild man. He finds a passport, a pair of trousers and shirt, rolled together and tied with a piece of thin rope; a pocketknife (the blade rusted from the salt air, I believe) and a slim book, “<i class="calibre5">The Life of Garibaldi.</i>” A letter, but no money; not a single lira, yet no one admitted their disappointment. Enzo took the opened letter, addressed to <i class="calibre5">Sig. Benati Natale</i>, Via Roma, 6, Palermu, Sicilia, that was posted over three months ago. He unfolded the letter to a single page and began to read.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">What is more annoying than seeing a man’s lips move when he reads?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He finished and seemed saddened by what he read, setting the letter on the floor.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Benati</i>. <i class="calibre5">Benati</i> is the old man’s name. *<i class="calibre5">Natale Benati</i>, from <i class="calibre5">Palermu</i>.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What does it say?” Santo asked, as he picked up the letter.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is the story of a dead man’s life, I am afraid. About his tragedy…maybe justice, but I do not know about that. The letter is from <i class="calibre5">Enrico Palluzzi</i>, a friend of Benati’s son, <i class="calibre5">Gennaro</i>, in America.  He regretfully informed the capu that his son was dead, having died instantly, when a horse reared in the street and crushed him to death.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca shook his head and took the letter from Enzo’s hand.  “The old man said he was going to find his son…I remember.” Enzo took the letter back and gazed on it.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Palluzzi</i> says the boy did not suffer, but is buried in a welfare plot, somewhere in New York, or Brooklyn. There is a granddaughter, and he thinks her name is <i class="calibre5">Santina</i>, now in an orphanage with nuns, in Queens, maybe, but he is not sure. Her mother is also dead, from a plague.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The picture in the locket was the <i class="calibre5">capu’s</i> son, Gennaro and the old man was going to find his granddaughter and the locket was for her. This was our best guess and we all agreed it was possible.  </p>
<p id="page_687" class="calibre6">Enzo gave out a great sigh.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Buried in a welfare plot. The son of a rich man in a cemetery of paupers. And his granddaughter, he never saw, or knew of, is motherless and living in some orphanage. And we say he was a rich man…we envied him.” He closed the valise and slid it under a pile of blankets. Luca confessed he lost the stomach for stealing, not that we had counted anything of value, except the locket and gloves, and what value were they to an honest man. We agreed to forget the valise, we had not seen it, or did we know the old man, or to where he has disappeared, if anyone should ask. Leave the valise for the crew, or let it rot. I did not care either way. Santo felt guilty and said we should look for the granddaughter and see that she has the locket the <i class="calibre5">capu</i> intended her to have.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is the right thing to do.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is a fool’s errand,” Enzo said. “Where is Queens? This poor girl could be anywhere in the country that is three thousand miles long, ocean to ocean, so I have been told.” I did not like that I knew her name, *<i class="calibre5">Santina Benati</i>, and the face of her father, <i class="calibre5">Gennaro Benati,</i> and her grandfather. It was almost like she is family. I should not have opened the locket.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">We talked about this Gennaro, the capu’s son, who died like the bandit his father killed. I asked what it meant, that both were crushed by a horse, and they seemed connected in a way. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo was impatient with me. “Coincidence. Nothing more.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But you said ‘justice,’ I heard it.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The rambling of an old man. Do not make too much of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo made the sign of the cross, “Was it justice, the way his son died?” </p>
<p id="page_688" class="calibre6">I thought hard. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How could this be justice? The son took no part in his father’s crime…if it was a crime. He swore it was an accident, more an act of God, or the nature of the horse.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe,” Santo said. “But God controls all things.” Luca laughed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He took Santo by the neck, they struggled, like two little boys. “You are a saint, like your cousin,” Luca said. “And if God controls all things, then He is responsible for everything bad as well as everything good?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo pushed him away. “What do heathens know about God?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“There is only what you can see, paesano. Nothing else. We will never know the truth. But I have an idea…<i class="calibre5">mangiamo</i>… let’s eat.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">We did the right thing, with the dead man’s property, not stealing it, yet leaving it for someone else to steal. Le them burn in hell, if there is a hell and I am certain there is, and I am sorry the poor orphan girl will never see her grandfather’s gift, but it had nothing to do with me. How am I to blame? Did I slap the horse, make it kill the bandit? But I admit, I thought how good the locket and chain would hang around Carmela’s slim neck. Would she wear it in place of her crucifix? Did she have a crucifix? Si, she did, and I recalled she wore it proudly, a gift from her sainted mother, and on thinking more of it, I realized she would not wear a locket instead of a crucifix, but maybe for special occasions, like a wedding, or a birth, or some other happy time, when God is not a thought. I felt better, as there are not many happy times. We ended it at that, our souls in good stead with the Lord, except Luca, who is a heathen, and does not believe in the soul, and for that reason he had no worry over such things.  </p>
<p id="page_689" class="calibre6">Tomorrow, we dock, they say, but this is rumor, and most rumors are not true and never happen. If it is true, today is our last meal on this goddamned boat. Luca held his nose.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The shit they did not serve the first thirteen days, will be served the fourteenth day.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">At the talk of ‘shit’ everyone’s bowls started to churn. The cabin started to empty, but I stayed and went on my knees and prayed, giving thanks that we arrived in one piece, and did not end up fish food, and I did not drown, though we were not yet at the dock. I stayed a while, looking in the nooks and crannies to see the things I did not see in the last few weeks. Finally showed in the dining room, they were still waiting to be fed. It was our surprise, this meal was no worse than the first, and it was not a bad meal considering they could have fed us rocks, with a little salt, and who would have bitched? Enzo looked for bread, there was none. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Gone,(<i class="calibre5">Andato),”</i> the cook yelled. ”You people eat like vultures.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No worry,” Luca replied. “We will bake bread tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I believed this meant that Luca would lead a raiding party of one, to find his bread and other things, and he did.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was that night, near seven o’clock (Enzo kept his nice pocket watch wound tight) a sailor come with instructions for the next day. “The day of departure,” he called it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do we get off tomorrow?’ Santo asked Enzo, who never answered. This sailor was young and muscular, maybe thirty, an impressive looking man, not a hair out of place, or a whisker on his face. His uniform was freshly made up, boots polished to a high gloss, and he looked more like an officer than a sailor, except he carried a notebook, and we know men with notebooks are not to be trusted. I have said this before, I know, but I have a hatred for these people, that I come by honest. When I was a boy, about ten, in the year of the <i class="calibre5">grande raccolto</i> (great harvest) there was a shortage of men because so many moved north the year before. I was hired, with other children, to pick fruit by the bushel. The best harvest in years, but no more pay, not a miserable cent more. Take it or leave it. We were hungry. Hungry people always take it. A swelling stomach was the club held over our heads, and it was a powerful club that intimidated men and women, made children cry. I hated these bastards, but one bastard stands out in my mind; an overseer, a boss, who strutted the fields like a cock rooster, carrying a notebook, wherein he made a mark for every bushel of fruit you picked. Not every bushel, because he kept the tenth bushel for himself. Sometimes the ninth and tenth bushel, if he did not like you, or  know your father. Complain? Who would listen? If they did, would they take the word of a dirt eater over a man with land? Your ass would be out in the street, or worse, in a ditch, or worse yet, a ditch filled with disease in the runoff from the pastures. When I see a man with a notebook…I see this overseer…this sonofabitch, and any man with a notebook is no good, and not to be trusted. I ramble. What was I saying? Si. This sailor who come to our cabin looked good and had the bearing of an officer, but his Italiano was poor, and thank God for Enzo. The sailor was *<i class="calibre5">Gustaf</i>, I heard. Gustaf. They say he was <i class="calibre5">Tedesco</i> (German). As soon as he came in the door, he reads from this paper hanging from the fucking clipboard.  </p>
<p id="page_690" class="calibre6">“This ship will dock in New York harbor early tomorrow morning. Rough currents and tides may be unfavorable. Lifeboats will ferry Third Class to the Island for examination.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Examination?  We stare at each other. The sound of the word terrified even the men, and what were the women thinking?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The <i class="calibre5">disadattati (</i>misfits),” he paused, smiling, as he looked around the cabin. “Excuse me,” he said in a horsy voice. “I meant passengers who are rejected, will be returned to their port of departure.” He said it and paused, then repeated it, that return passage was not included in the original fare. Anyone denied entry, man or woman, will work their way back home. No exceptions for age, or physical condition.” He cleared his throat and stood stiff. “Not the lame, or the women or children, must pay. There <i class="calibre5">are</i> no free rides on this line.” A question from the cabin, that he could not hear clearly, he said, was ignored.   </p>
<p id="page_691" class="calibre6">“Three out of a hundred, or more, they say, are sent back.” He paused and smiled.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Near thirty will go back. Have your papers ready and cause these people no trouble.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He brushed at his left sleeve and picked something from it and dropped it to the floor.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Restunni said, never slouch, or stoop over, or tell the truth when a lie will suit you better, or tremble or stare away like a whipped dog.    </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">The women ignored him, his attitude. They were getting ready the children to leave.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">I did not understand this word, ‘<i class="calibre5">disadattati.</i>’ To Enzo, it was a man who had no place in the world, anywhere. Did he mean Luca, who seems to have thrown himself with Conte? Santo’s heart is bad, if that means anything. Enzo? What do we know about him? He is educated. He speaks well; his sins might well be overlooked. That leaves me, and right away, I see myself being pushed off the Island, on a ship to Italia. What do I say when I get back to Sicilia, disgraced? The sailor cleared his throat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The conditions back will not be pleasant, like the trip over,” and we laughed at this, but quietly, to ourselves. “Selected” passengers, he said, would go through immigration onboard and then delivered to the city. By “selected,” he meant passengers of the First and Second Class.”  The “privileged” and the “selected,” were the same thing, since  their papers were always complete and correct, and they were never deported as ‘misfits’ or ‘undesirable.’  I was used to this, and not angry or put out by the way were being treated, as it is the nature of things and not all that bad if you never think on it. Soon it will be over, when I die, if I am allowed to die. Enzo laughs when I say this.   </p>
<p id="page_692" class="calibre6">“Soon it will be over? You are so naïve,” <i class="calibre5">ingenuo</i>, he said.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“When you are, they will still own what is left.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Gustaf passed on the captain’s gratitude for a smooth trip, with no problems. The Captain, a German, did nothing about complaints of unbearable heat in steerage, the bad food(not what Luca had stolen for us), or foul air, or his bully crew, and the riots, if there were riots, as no one has officially said there were riots, except the men who were there. While he talked on and on, Luca kept whispering “bullshit,” under his breath, ten, maybe fifteen times, and each time I laughed, and finally I turn away so Gustaf (<i class="calibre5">Goostaf</i>) would not see me laugh, and think I was being disrespectful.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Seven in the morning on the next day, the last day, the feeling of things had changed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The engines were smoother, steadier, almost pleasant sounding. At seven thirty, the engines were idled, and we drifted with the current, so they said. After a while, the engines full stopped, and there was an uproar and applause, that I am certain was heard in the great city, where we would dock. Me? My stomach churned hot, and I spent most of the last hour in the toilet, lucky to have beaten out ten men with the same problem.      </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Diarrhea</i>. <i class="calibre5">Merda</i>. The shits.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A sailor walked the halls of steerage, knocking at closed doors and pounding on walls, yelling out, “get ready.” We waited to be assigned a boat that would take us to the island.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I shit my pants, a little, like when the boss yells at me. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A leak?” Enzo said. How did he know? </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Nothing serious. Breathe deeply. You are not alone.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">These last few hours were bad, the waiting, as men like me are not meant to wait; we work, or we sleep, there is no wait for <i class="calibre5">contadini</i>. Wait is rest, not work. We always work. Standing in a line, doing nothing, <i class="calibre5">not </i>working, <i class="calibre5">or</i> sleeping, is against what we are. The gut of this beast is not made for rest. Fresh air is what I needed, and a purpose. Some have not changed clothes in two or three weeks and think how a room without fresh air would smell. I do not count the women, as women are naturally clean, except two of the women who threw up every day, and their men blamed it on the smell in the cabin, a vicious odor that could gag a beast. Myself, I made three changes of clothes during the trip and cleaned myself regular, when I could, and the toilet was not crowded. As I think back, to be honest, three changes were two, as I counted the clothes I wore onto the ship as a change. With all the stink, who could tell. Was it shit, or the air? Someone told a joke, that steerage was always a good fart away from catching on fire.  </p>
<p id="page_693" class="calibre6">A fart away. <i class="calibre5">Una scoreggia</i>.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">We waited like good soldiers. I thought about mama and papa, seeing their faces in the shadows cast against the wall. How would they know I was here, that I arrived safe and was thinking of them and home? Maybe Enzo will write for me, and in two months they will know.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Assunta</i>, the young girl from Colleberardi, was ready, I see, a good a soldier. I promised  we would watch over her through the lines, until her brother and his friend, Bernardo shows, if they do. She smiled and thanked me, and I thought about Carmela, who was with me from the start, never leaving my side. The girl from Colleberardi was shaking, so I touched her arm and she stepped away from me. I apologized, as I meant her no disrespect.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca, my luckless friend, is hostage to this ruthless <i class="calibre5">brigand</i>, Silvio Conte, who has ordered him to wait at the pier, where friends from “<i class="calibre5">Brukland</i>” will bring them all to the city, but Luca swore he will not be taken where he does not want to go. What else could he say?  I am confused by all the plans I heard, but I believe, and I may be wrong, his last plan was to jump into the bay and disappear, but the water must be frigid, and he would be dead from the cold in minutes, and the current would take his corpse out to sea. He thought of not leaving the boat, to  stowaway and return to Sicilia a failure, a disgraced man, laughed at and scorned by every man, but behind his back. Did we boast too much? The best thought he had, and in the end we agreed it was his only choice, that once he passed inspection he would take off into the woods, if there were woods, but did he have any chance outrunning a bullet in the back, even from his uncles relic of a pistol. Santo said we should attack Conte and his men, no one took this idea serious, including Santo. Three farm hands and a soft bellied schoolteacher, fighting men who study the art of murder.   </p>
<p id="page_694" class="calibre6">I say Luca, my good friend for life, is on his own.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Of course, I was ashamed of myself.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They cannot watch me forever,” he said. “I will play along to stay alive…when the time is right...I will escape.” Run now, or run later, in either case he is a dead man, and I will miss him. I spent the last few nights thinking of a good story to tell the village, when we are home in Sicilia, if we are ever home again. Luca died a hero, I will say, and fill in the rest with words  Enzo said he would be proud to create, if asked.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">I patiently leaned against the wall for support until the call came, and when it did, I felt good in the head, but my stomach fell to my tired feet, and my legs wobbled when I walked. I felt like an old man, with too many fears. A fear of new things, of new people and places, of questions and the cold and the night. I know what I am thinking, but when I say it, I babble it and stutter at even the simple words. It should be enough, that I am a hard worker and no troublemaker. All I want is a small taste of what other men have; not all of it, or a lot of it, just a taste. Treat me fair, with respect, and I will do work the <i class="calibre5">americani</i> men will not do, for little pay, even a meal if I am starving.   </p>
<p id="page_695" class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Never slouch…stand tall, like a man</i>.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">As we walked to the cabin door, I took a last look of what was home for two or three weeks. No matter the smell, or the heat, or the dirty air, it was home. And home, is home, is home, my grandfather always said. Was I here two weeks, or three weeks? I cannot say for sure, and in truth, now I did not give a shit as it no longer mattered.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">When the call  came, we moved into the corridor, shoulder to shoulder with all the rest, and we walked slow, small steps, shuffle steps, dragging our bags along the floor. One corridor, then two corridors, and three, until all merged into one. Who pushed? Who shoved? No one pushed or shoved, and I heard no cursing, and it was the fear of being kicked out of line that kept us civilized. The line is the world, where everything comes from.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The climb up three stairways was slow and tedious, like a journey in itself, and by the second landing my legs ached. When I walked onto the deck, there was no cargo, and the cold wind hit me square in the face; clean and fresh air, and I smiled when I felt it, though I hate the cold. For two weeks, or three weeks, every morning, the first thing when I woke, I wiped the soot from the edge of my nose, and only God knows how much I breathed in during the night. Those days, I believed…I hoped…were over for me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">How many days has it been since I see the sun? Twelve, thirteen, maybe fourteen. Some say three weeks. Now, when I am finally here, in the open, the sun is half behind dark, thick clouds, but I pretend she is in her glory, and I was warmed and comforted. She blinded me when I looked straight at her, but how could I look away? Warmth is good, and warmth made me safe, and the pain in my joints were gone. Was it in my head? We were herded away from the center to places along the railing, where boats were lowered into the bay. We waited on orders from the officer-in-charge, who stood erect, his back to the Island.   </p>
<p id="page_696" class="calibre6">I never saw such a sight; this Island, in the middle of a great bay, surrounded by a fearsome city. The wind shifted and she spoke to me, this city. I was bumped and startled by a man from behind.  “<i class="calibre5">Scusa</i>,” he said, “I was not looking where I walked, but at other things.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He pointed to the sky.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A magnificent sight,” he said, with great emotion, like a woman’s emotion, and I was embarrassed for him. When I looked where he pointed, in the morning sky, and I saw her and was awed that such a thing could be made by men, and wondered, how did I not see it on my own?  *<i class="calibre5">Benito Maranzano</i>, a friend from home, was here two years back, and he saw her and said I would see her and never forget as long as I lived. An old woman, carrying a  suitcase in each hand, dropped them to the deck and made the sign of the cross, and her eyes teared as she grabbed her man by the arm and looked and he said it was a sight every poor man should see once in his life. </p>
<p class="calibre6"> A woman with outstretched arms, was there in her glory, like <i class="calibre5">Maranzano</i> said, in green and a thousand feet tall. I believe she looked straight at me, right into my eyes; I swear to this day I could hardly breathe; my heart beat like a hummingbird’s heart, and there was a lump caught in my throat. I swear it. I should have been on my knees, but I did not have the courage to be the first to give thanks. A young woman, with no coat, holding a child who was all bundled, maybe in rags, was the first to kneel and I watched her pray and finger the beads of an old rosary. Her lips moved slow, she was reverent, and her cheeks were wet with tears. God knows what she left behind, if anything, maybe nothing or no one, or maybe her whole family, except the beautiful child she carried and held close. <i class="calibre5">Siclianu</i> men tell this lie, and with pride, that we never weep, or show emotion. I gave thanks for all He allowed me to see this wonderful sight, and to be in this new world, with a new life. If what comes after this, is no better than this moment, it will be enough for me.                                              </p>
<p id="page_697" class="calibre6">I grab Enzo’s arm.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My God, look at her. She is staring at me…into my eyes.”  She said to me, I swear it, ‘<i class="calibre5">Benvenuti</i> in America, Antonino.’” I felt delivered on seeing her, yet ashamed that I was here alone, without my family, or Carmela and I asked forgiveness, saying I was a selfish man.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo spoke with emotion, “she is marvelous. I have seen her before, in pictures, a painting. No book can describe the feeling when you see her for the first time.” He turned away and  wiped his eyes and coughed to clear his throat. “This is the best day of my life,” he said, looking at her again, “No matter what happens, no matter, I swear no day will ever be as good as this day.” Some men cried, others embraced other men, without shame, and <i class="calibre5">all</i> the women cried. Enzo said, for all to hear, that now he wanted more time, admitting his own end was not far off.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He took my arm and I see joy and sadness in his eyes.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“How I envy your youth. Ten more years. This is all I want, just ten more years.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo envies me, he said, and I have not been envied before, or since that day. How do I explain what I felt, except to say, I believe this feeling, of a new freedom, would not be as great for anyone who has never wondered on his next meal, or not lived at the whim of men who owned him, or God forbid, buried a child because he was thirsty and drank the water? The air got colder as the wind changed; now from the north, and the light rain changed to light snow, but no one cared, as I could tell. Who was not in awe of this great woman, and what did it matter if there came a blizzard? What was the snow and the cold against all of this?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I ask Enzo, the torch in her hand, her right hand, what does it mean?    </p>
<p id="page_698" class="calibre6">“It is a beacon, Antonino. A light that shows the way. Do you see it? And the tablet  cradled in her left arm? Do you see it?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I did see I, and wondered. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If I recall, it says July 4, 1776, the day these Americani adopted their Declaration of Independence, casting off English chains from a hundred years. And today, what is it? March 13, March 14? Whatever day it is, maybe it is our day.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">What did he mean? I was not certain, though it must be important for the way he said it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I do not know the day, Enzo, but I will ask when we reach the Island.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He laughed, but I do not believe he was laughing at me, but what I said. How could he read the words, that were so far away?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Because I have read the words many times, and committed them to heart, as they are universal, for all of us, even the sorriest of men.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">There were four or five men around us, and they brought their children in close and waited, maybe hoping he would recite the words, and he did, with deep emotion I have never heard from a man.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">“Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">With conquering limbs astride from land to land; </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">From her beacon-hand </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. </i></p>
<p id="page_699" class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">With silent lips.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">He stopped, and there was quiet, and the wind calmed, like some sign. Enzo smiled and cleared his throat and went on.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">“Give me your tired, your poor, </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">When he finished, I shivered. It was hard to breathe.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">A man we knew go be a beggar, raised his son atop his shoulders and pointed to the sky. “Salvatore, the ‘woman with a torch,’ throw her a kiss,” and when he did, we cheered, and he held the boy at arm’s length, then pulled him close, kissing his cheeks, hard, until they were a red.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">She welcomed us to the golden door. But in the end, Enzo said, was she just a statue, made of metal and green, or something with meaning for the ages?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Clear a path,” the sailor yelled. We did as we were told and moved to the railing, and he called the order to lower the boats to deck level. We were first in the boat, and took our seats in the front, Enzo saying, and proudly, he would be the first man in America, “in a manner of speaking.” Each boat had eight rows of seats, separated by an aisle way: four places to a side. A total of thirty-six people, including the four oarsmen, young and muscular. This one, tall sailor, who was master, so it seemed, kept repeating, “watch your step,” but there was pushing I am sorry to say, but not in a violent way.  I put a foot into the lifeboat, and I felt the excitement, of a sort, but at the same time I thought of *<i class="calibre5">Grazia Stirpe</i>, the women on the ferry at <i class="calibre5">Villa San Giovanni</i>. We should have not left her in the care of the priest, greedy sonofabitch, and I felt guilty she would never see this sight, or ever be here. It was my fault, as I stood silent.    </p>
<p id="page_700" class="calibre6">The D’arrico’s, God bless them, and I hope they will live to see this sight.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">And the others we passed along the way. <i class="calibre5">Dio li benedica tutti.</i></p>
<p class="calibre6">We took a place on the rough-cut seats, waiting for the master to order the boat down; Luca and me on one side, Enzo and Santo across the aisle. Enzo leaned and tapped my shoulder. I turned. “Look to your left,” he said. “More people.” Another ship had arrived in the harbor, and at that instance she dropped anchor, and I hear the splash above the wind, that had died down. The deck of the ship was crowded, and I could  hear their voices when I listened hard, though they were fifty yards away, or more. Every man and woman on deck, as I could see, stood at the rail, gazing at the great sight standing in the harbor. Enzo cleared his throat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“She opened the door for all of us. Who are the ‘tired and the poor,’ if not us? If not us, then who? She will stand a thousand years, until there are no more poor and tired, and men are not forced to leave their home just to work and eat and put clothes on their children, and most of all, to be free from fear…a thousand years.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. A wonderful sight, Enzo.” He patted my shoulder from across the aisle.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I ask him to stay near me, in case I cannot answer the questions, that I hear are meant only to trick and deceive.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will,” he said. “Be sure of it. As close as I can be but remember what he said…stand tall and you will be tall.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded. “<i class="calibre5">Si. Ricordo</i>. ‘Never slouch,’ *<i class="calibre5">Restunni</i> said.” There was truth to it, I believed, but it was like an old joke, and everyone laughed when we said it, but I promised myself I would stand straight and look them in the eye. There was a man in front of me with a child, who was frightened and crying. The man, who I did not know, turned and excused himself for listening, and asked, what does ‘never slouch’ mean?  He was confused, more bothered we had information he did not. He apologized for his daughter’s tears, “she is nervous and does not feel safe in these little boats.” Before I could explain what Restunni said, he excused himself and tried to calm the girl, who asked for her mother, but there was no woman, as I could tell. I wondered if he traveled alone, without a wife, but I was taken back by a course yell from the back of the boat.  </p>
<p id="page_701" class="calibre6">“Luca, my friend,” he yells, enough to wake the dead.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was Conte. That sonofabitch.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"> He pointed to the island. “Meet me when this is over,” and the look on Luca’s face was surprise, as if he thought Conte would not to show up, and his threat was nothing but a dream. Poor Luca, my friend, was like a chicken trapped in the boat, and Conte was the fox, but I have said this before. At first Luca did not answer, instead, staring off into the horizon, as if he had not heard the piercing sound of Conte’s savage yell. Everyone heard him, and I do not believe Luca fooled Conte one bit. He called out ‘Luca,’ again, louder, so loud his voice came out horse and raw.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Luca. <i class="calibre5">Capisce</i>, my friend…meet me,” and he pointed to the Island. Conte was a head taller than every man around him, so his voice carried well, even against the wind in our faces. Luca forced a smile. “<i class="calibre5">Capisco</i>, if I can,” he said. Conte pushed his way to where we sat, and there he was, smiling, like some fool who refuses to believe he was not wanted. He bullied a man out of his seat and sat behind us. The poor bastard protested to the master, only to be ordered to find a seat, or take the floor. Conte was behind us, breathing at our backs, while Luca turned white like he had been bled by the barber, who was drunk. Conte smiled, an evil smile, “you are my pisano,” he said, putting his huge arm around Luca’s neck, but playfully, like two boys rolling in the field.   </p>
<p id="page_702" class="calibre6">“Luca, friend. You and me, we will make history.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca nodded without looking him in the eye, then coughed to clear his throat.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, Silvio, whatever you say. I work for you.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Work for me?  Is that what you said, my friend? Work for me?” Conte puts his face close to Luca’s face. “My friend…you belong to me,” and he smiled, but Luca did not seem angry at this insult, and I guessed he already knew it to be true.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why are you here?” Luca asked him. “I thought First Class stayed on the boat and…”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“First class? *<i class="calibre5">Finocchi</i>? Cavones. All of them. Not my kind of people. The women are more men than the men. No, my friend, I am a just a poor dirt farmer, like you, traveling in steerage because I have no money.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He winked. He laughed. “It is nothing but a trick to fool these bastards.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But we never saw you in…” He put up his hand, stopping me cold. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you think, paesano?  I would live down there with the <i class="calibre5">rifiuti (</i>the garbage)?” He smiles at me. “<i class="calibre5">Scusa</i>, of course, I am not referring to you and Luca.” He patted my knee and lowered his voice. “But the rest of your crew. That that fucking old man across the aisle,” he said, pointing to Enzo. “<i class="calibre5">Rifiuti</i>, garbage. Nothing else. I bought a steerage ticket, but the smell down there…not for me. So, you sign up for steerage and get lost, and nobody asks nothing. Pass around a few lire and you are the invisible man, forgotten.  But never worry. Silvio will show you the way. Capisce?  That is how I like it…we like it…nobody knows our business.” And never tell anyone your business.” </p>
<p id="page_703" class="calibre6">The ride was short, a few minutes, not a pleasant ride, as the waves and the current bounced us all over hell, and a child in front would not stop crying as she hung onto her  father’s neck; but I envied her. Our friend from Colleberardi, sat three rows back, sitting at the rail and staring out to sea. Was she thinking of her brother and the old man in Italia? If not let in tp this country, she will go back home and probably marry the old man, and pray he dies quick. I leaned to Luca.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I want to watch out for her.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Better you should watch out for me.  What do you know about her, who she is? Is she a dece3nt woman or a puttanu? What do you know?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">My guts ached, because I needed the toilet, and I admit this, that before we landed, I pissed my pants, but no one saw the stain as I cover it with my hand all the way, and it dried before I stepped off the boat, from the force of the wind. Three of the thirty-two in our boat  threw up before we hit the island. Only women, no men or children. When I see the dock through the fog, a strange thing happened; the fear of leaving home was gone, but now I was terrified of being in America. Fear? What else do I know? Fear, that has a special feel to it, that I cannot describe, but I hate it, then and now. My cousin, <i class="calibre5">*Giuseppe Moro</i>, said his life changed forever when his mother and father died the same week, from some sickness. He says he is afraid to get up in the morning and go to bed at night. He will always be an orphan, his fear, and I have always wondered if this is what one man tells another. I am an orphaned child, but I have orphaned myself, as my mother and father are not dead, but left behind.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was still snowing, and now the wind kicked up and the temperature dropped. I raised my collar and turned away from the wind, and it was then I saw it behind me, the great sight of grand buildings and bridges, and me without the right words to describe what I saw. In my world, a great bridge is a long, sturdy plank, or a felled tree across a creek, but what I saw seemed miles long, disappearing into the horizon. How could this have been made by men? God surely made it to his own likeness. I called to Enzo, who was talking with the man from Catania. </p>
<p id="page_704" class="calibre6">“I have seen the pictures,” he said, and turned away.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">The oarsman stopped and we coasted silently to the dock. The four of us…well, the five of us, including <i class="calibre5">Conte</i>, stood and began the longest walk of our lives. We were the first boat to the dock, meaning one of us would be the first to step a foot in America. A sailor threw a line to a workman on the dock, who tied us off and pulled the plank in place. Conte worked himself to the front of the line, and would be the first in America from our ship, but he left his bag in the back of the boat when he strong armed the man out of his seat, and he cursed and went back to retrieve it. Enzo walked the short plank, and it teetered some, but he managed, and he was the first to step foot on the Island. He turned to the rest of us and smiled.   <span class="calibre14">“And last shall be </span></p>
<p class="calibre4">first,” he said, and I believed the words were biblical, from the bible, or some other religious writing.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca was a few feet behind Enzo and kept looking over both shoulders, maybe wondering if his end was near. He is lost, and his soul is lost, and maybe his life. This crazy idea he schemed to save himself, it is weak and feeble and poorly planned. These men are <i class="calibre5">barbari</i>, barbarians, Enzo says this, and it is true. They are fishhooks, impossible to escape them once they have you and you are theirs, no matter how strong the wiggle. Even the most heathen of these bastards, must have the soul to have the man, but they never lose.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">I prayed for Luca as I stepped off the boat and asked my God to help him.          </p>
<p class="calibre6">Conte smiled when he came off the plank, like a watch dog, his head all over the place as he surveyed the boat and the docks for trouble, and trouble meaning the law. Standing between us and the building, two cops, two big men, as big as Conte and mean looking (maybe meaner than Conte). They eyed us up and down, watching every step we took, and they paid attention to our women, looking them over, good, like a man would check a horse before taking a ride.             </p>
<p id="page_705" class="calibre6">“Follow your nose to the building,” says the biggest cop, pointing his stick left. When Enzo came on the two cops, who were giants looking down on him, he dropped his suitcase to the dock. The young cop pushed Enzo by the shoulder, “move along, now...there are a thousand more behind you.” Enzo spoke in his finest English, so they listened and did not ignore him.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Officers, question…I mean excuse me, <i class="calibre5">may</i> I you ask a question?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The young cop, of course, had no patience, and he plain yelled at Enzo, ordering him to “move along.” We were nervous and anxious, even Conte wiped the back of his neck, though the wind was cold, but Enzo would not be put off, and he spoke slow and steady to the cops, who were not of a mind to listen. Our friend from Catania, *<i class="calibre5">Pietro Iannuzzi</i>, stepped away from Enzo, and stood with me and repeated in Sicilianu everything said to the cops.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Officer, please, <i class="calibre5">una domanda</i>. Excuse me. May I ask a question?  I want to be a good American?”  Before the cop could say ‘no,’ Enzo asked, “is it legal to bring a loaded pistol into your country?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The cops look at each other and laughed. “A loaded pistol?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The big cop, hands on his hips, night stick dangling near the ground, looked down at Enzo.  “Why?” he asked. “How many do you have?” and when they stopped laughing, he was  ordered to move on, “or else.” But Enzo did not move right off, and I see he was tapping his foot on the dock, like a nervous man would do. Finally, “grazie,” he said, politely to the cops and picked up his valise and walked toward the building, stopping after a few steps. He stared straight ahead, and I see he was like a man out of breath.    </p>
<p id="page_706" class="calibre6">The big cop pushes Enzo down the line. “I told you to move on…now move on,” but Enzo, being near an old man, stumbled and fell. I gave him a hand up and asked if he was crazy, did he like the abuse they gave him?  “Not really,” he said, smoothing his jacket.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Gentlemen (he did not call them officers, or cops), before you push me down again, I believe it is my duty to inform you that the seventh in line, the tall, well-dressed man, is concealing a pistol in his coat pocket…and I believe it is loaded and he is a dangerous, as he has told me many times, he would delight in killing an American policeman, or two. ‘For fun of it,’ I believe he said.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">*<i class="calibre5">Pietro Iannuzzi</i> wiped the sweat from the back of his neck. The cops look at Conte, who was the seventh man in line, and he stared back at the cops staring at him, and like a trapped animal he began looked for his way out, a path to retreat, to survive.           </p>
<p class="calibre6">Me and Santo were of the same mind; we took small steps backwards, hoping not to be noticed, to keep out of the crossfire should Conte feel trapped, and see no way but a shootout with these cops. Enzo, for what reason, turned bold, and strolled down the line, like on a Sunday walk in the piazza, stopping in front of Conte.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This is the man to whom I refer, officers” he said, stuttering some (he was nervous) and he stepped away, making room for the two cops who stood tight on his back.  Conte was quick, cat quick, and he screamed curses at Enzo, punching him brutally in the face, then made his run for it, bumping a woman with a child, near sending them both into the cold bay. He ran, and he ran fast, for a big man, and the cops ordered him to stop (‘halt’ is what they say in America) but he did not, and when they blew whistles, it seemed in seconds three more cops joined the chase. Five cop’s total. I give Conte this, he was good on his feet, doing fine with his escape, maybe a hundred feet ahead of the five cops, until he made a bad guess and a wrong turn put him at the end of the dock (a dead end, they say) and nowhere to go but into the icy water in the bay. He looks at the pursuing cops, then the freezing bay, and he screamed vulgarities, but he refused to jump. He was a man of impressive strength, and to his credit it took all five cops to bring him down. At first it was a simple fight, fists, some kicking, until he tried to pull the pistol from his pocket and the cops saw it. Three cops, each in turn, biggest first, clubbed him across the left knee as it was the closest, and the sharp, piercing cracks, like the sound of a tree limbs breaking, sent shivers down the back of my legs (thank God it is not me, I thought). His right knee  received the same treatment, and seeing the smiles, I believe these cops took pride in their work, as they seemed skillful at it, and willing to do it all day long. Conte showed great stamina, a quality in any man. He rolled on the dock, screaming in pain, but with enough energy left to curse the cops and their mothers, and Enzo and Luca, and swearing to get even with them all. He did not mention my name, as I recall. Thank God. The line stood by and watched, quietly, showing Conte some sympathy, especially a few women who complained on the brutality, making their children turn away. One of the women wondered aloud, and most heard it, that she hoped it was not a mistake coming to America. <i class="calibre5">Si</i>, the cops were harsh, but Conte, a tough Sicilianu, could take it, as he did this for a living, and he would have done the same to the cops if he had the chance. He would not surrender, he refused, even as they locked the chains around his hands and torso. I thought about the old man, <i class="calibre5">Benati, </i>who hated the contadini. What happened to him?  “Fuck him,” I thought. “Beat him more and better,” I said under my breath, as they drag him like a side of meat, through a rusted iron door at the end of the dock, and it clanked loud when it slammed shut behind him.  He was gone, out of sight, but we could still hear his curses, swearing vengeance and threats against Enzo and Luca, vowing they would suffer unmerciful deaths. I recalled what Enzo said about <i class="calibre5">irony</i>. Conte was a free man, now he is a prisoner, and Luca was a prisoner, and now he is a free man. If this is what he meant by irony, it is clear to me, now.  </p>
<p id="page_708" class="calibre6">Did anyone hear Conte mention my name, <i class="calibre5">Antonino Sparacino</i>?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">No? Thank God. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca gave Enzo a hand up from where he lay on the dock; there was blood on his mouth and his cheek was swollen, pretty bad. He lost a tooth, but an old one, he joked, that he had little use for it, or would he miss it.  I looked at Enzo and saw a man who was now honorable in my eyes. A thief, or not, who was I to judge his life? What did he steal? Small change from a rich bastard’s son? And the rich man who complained, is he better than Enzo, more a moral man? I am certain he stole his wealth from someone else, or from <i class="calibre5">everyman</i> who ever worked for him. Enzo stole from a thief, at least the son of a thief, so I figured can stealing stolen money be a crime, or immoral? How could it be the same as stealing money that was not already stolen?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo stood before Luca and put out his hand and cleared his throat.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I blamed myself for what he tried to do to you,”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca thanked him for what he did, promising if he ever prayed, he would pray Conte dies in jail, “or we are all dead men.” They shook hands, embraced and Enzo was moved.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Luca, my friend, I am responsible for this trouble because I opened my mouth about your pistol. I could not let your life be ruined because I am a <i class="calibre5">cavone</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Gratzie, again,” Luca said, and there was a quiet between the two men. Enzo nodded and picked up his valise and looked for a place in the line. Luca moved in behind him and took his arm. “Enzo. When did Conte say he wanted to kill cops? That pissed them off, bad.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh, that.” Enzo scratched his chin, wincing from the wound on his face. “Well, you see, Luca…I made it up…as you say, it pissed them off bad, but by design.” We had a good laugh over his lie, and his lie worked so well, and without a good lie the cops might have looked the other way, or Conte might have bullshitted them, or thrown the pistol in the bay.    </p>
<p id="page_709" class="calibre6">I have always been against lies and lying, and liars. Not that day.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo spit blood onto the deck. “Luca. The old man? <i class="calibre5">Benati</i>? What happened to him?” Luca took a deep breath and wrung his hand together.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The night of the fight Conte shot the old man in the head and threw his carcass overboard.  I did…I saw him do it…just a few feet away. Silvio laughed, ‘the old bastard is where he belongs, with the fish,’ he said. He spits into the ocean and lights a cigar.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I asked Luca, straightaway, “did you help him do it…murder the old man, I mean?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I wanted the truth, but if he did, I wanted him to lie.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca raised his right hand to the morning sky.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My hand to God,” he said. “May He strike me dead. <i class="calibre5">Niente</i>. I had nothing to do with it. But I did nothing to stop it.” He looked me square in the eye, that made me nervous and uncomfortable. “Am I guilty, as you see it?” I recall that moment, no one offered an opinion, not even Enzo, and it was not his nature to be silent. Conte admitted to Luca he was sent by his boss to even the score with <i class="calibre5">Benati</i>, as punishment for killing one of their own, and in front of the workers (this is what made them angry). Thugs for the bosses captured Benati’s cousin, “convincing” him it was right to give up <i class="calibre5">Benati’s</i> whereabouts, by breaking most of the bones in his body, and finally he confessed and named the boat <i class="calibre5">Benati</i> was taking to America.  The *<i class="calibre5">Antonio Lopez</i>, and on what day and at what port. They hung the cousins battered body in the piazza, as a warning, and Conte laughed that it looked more like a pile of empty clothes, than a human man broken apart. We asked no other questions, and we never spoke of the <i class="calibre5">capu</i> or <i class="calibre5">Conte </i>again<i class="calibre5">; </i>but they are like air, always there, but invisible, and if that was the best I could do, then it was good enough for me.         </p>
<p id="page_710" class="calibre6"> A cop, gold badge on his hat and chest (the other two cops were silver, but not real silver, I bet) asked, did we know Conte’s real name, and where was he is from, since they found four passports on his ‘person.’ Three from Italia, one from Ireland (irlanda, near inghilterra, Enzo said). The boss cop was an old man, older than Enzo, but he mixed it up good in the fight with Conte; now he seemed tired, but claimed his malady was nothing a good beer, or two, or a shot of Irish whiskey could not cure. He searched for his spectacles, then struggled to fit them to his nose, as they kept slipping and this caused him embarrassment. “Goddamn these things,” he said, holding them steady as he read the names off the passports, Conte’s carried on his ‘person.’  </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “He may be <i class="calibre5">Enrico Vitale</i>, <i class="calibre5">Giovanni Policastro</i>, <i class="calibre5">Silvio Berluzzi</i>, or <i class="calibre5">Harry O’Brien</i>, from Dublin. My sainted mother,” he bowed his head, “God rest her soul, was from Dublin, and this <i class="calibre5">dago</i> bastard is not.” Enzo said we knew him as Silvio Conte, but could offer no other information, not even where he boarded, or his age. Then Enzo tells the cop Conte murdered an old man and threw him over the side.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The cop looks up from his notebook, his eyes wide.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A murder? You say he’s a murderer?” He glanced at the cops who had gathered.  “Who did he murder?” Then a pause. “Where did it happen?” A short pause. “In the harbor?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“An old man, <i class="calibre5">Benati,” </i>Enzo said. “I forget his first name.” The cop repeated the name, <i class="calibre5">Benati,</i> and wrote it down in his book.  “Benati. B-E-N-A-T-I?  Where and when?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A few days ago, at sea. His body was dumped over the side. This is what we hear.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6"> The cop looks up from his notebook, hearing the words ‘at sea.’   </p>
<p id="page_711" class="calibre6">“At sea? International waters?” The cop (a captain, Enzo said, an important man in America) ripped the page from his book, crumpled it and threw it into the bay.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have no jurisdiction,” he said, not that he was unconcerned about such a vicious crime.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Report it to the shipping company. They will say what to do.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo thought of protesting, he said later, but protesting to the cop would be like pissing into the wind. Who concerns himself with an old immigrant murdered in the middle of the ocean?  Not this gold cop, or the two silver cops. He had the right notion as I could see. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“To hell with it all,” he said. And to this we agreed.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo asked the captain, who was O’Leary<i class="calibre5">…*Terrance O’Leary</i>, from Brooklyn.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This Conte, whatever his name is, will he go to prison? For a long time?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Prison?” The captain laughs. As did his subordinates. “Four loaded pistols…assaulting five police officers…ten, fifteen years. And if, I say ‘if’ he survives, he gets sent back to where he came from, probably still on crutches, or at least a cane.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Four guns,” we said it at the same time. This Captain opens a valise showing what they took from Conte, but in all I counted five guns. When asked on the fifth gun, the cop picked it out of the valise and I see, right off, it was Luca’s pistol.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This one we cannot count,” he said. “Its junk. Worthless. The firing pin is busted clean off. It’s not a gun. No more than a chunk of rusted iron. An old relic…junk, as I said. Here, take it as a souvenir,” and he pushed it to Enzo, who backed away, throwing up his hands. In turn the cop offered it to each man, who refused it. When the gun was offered to Luca, he said he no longer believed in guns, and Enzo could barely translate with a straight face. “All this god dammed trouble over a piece of iron, not worth a pound of nails,” I thought, but would not say.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Palermo, I think,” Enzo said.  </p>
<p id="page_712" class="calibre6">“Palermo…what about Palermo?” the cop asked.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You asked, did we know where he is from. Palermo. <i class="calibre5">Si</i>, Palermo.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The captain shook his head as he wrote it in his book. I envied any man who could write, even a cop. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sicily?” He laughed. “I should have known.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I have not heard such a mocking tone when any man mentioned my country, not even from Irish men, when even the sober ones insulted my heritage.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We have seen a lot of bad men come here from Sicily,” the cop said. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo almost choked from the speed at which he had to translate. These Irish( the cops were Irish, or did I say it?) they all talked fast, even when sober.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you men from Sicily?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo cleared his throat. “We should catch up with the line,” and we turned our backs to the cop and walked away. Four of us, not five. It was a great day.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Behind us in the bay, more boats, four now, and hundreds of people(mostly peasants) being ferried to the Island, and I believed what Enzo said, thousands would come today. I asked myself for the hundredth time, have I done the right thing coming here, all for some great <i class="calibre5">maybe</i>? Mama and papa? What about them? What were they doing?  Sleeping? No. It is the afternoon in <i class="calibre5">Sicilia</i>. Papa is working, if he has work for the day, if he is not sick and can walk all right and at that moment, I felt I had done the wrong thing. The weakest we left behind and I am ashamed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was a great room, like no room I had seen before, but not ornate, like a rich church, or all cathedrals. Big, <i class="calibre5">grande</i>, and the noises were there, but soothing, like sounds from the mountain, and the noise of people walking and talking and stirring in line, all echoing from the walls and ceiling, and everything said was said twice, if you listened close. My palms were wet and greasy, I was lightheaded, like the feeling from a wine drunk; my heart beat fast, and it was hard to breathe. God almighty, if You are there, where they say You are, kill me now, but do not let me faint in front of these strange men and women.   </p>
<p id="page_713" class="calibre6">I grab Santo’s arm and stutter, like some fool.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“If I pass out, leave me where I fall and move on.  Do not shine a light on me. I will  catch up with you.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si, si</i>,” he said, holding his stomach, near doubled over himself.        </p>
<p class="calibre8">Cops patrolled each line, with pistols in their holsters and sticks that swung from their </p>
<p class="calibre4">belts. I have learned this about life, and I believe it is a truth, that if you see a line join it, stay in it, keep it straight and orderly, never push, shove, or ask, “why does the line move so slow?” They will say you are a complainer, but remember, good lines and straight lines are important to men who matter. This one cop eyes me up and down, more than in passing, or in the line of duty, as if we knew each other some other time or place. When I move past him, he looked me straight on in the eyes. “<i class="calibre5">Che paese</i>? (What town?),” he asked in perfect <i class="calibre5">Sicilianu</i>, thank God. He was a cop, in any case, no matter how good he spoke my language.  </p>
<p class="calibre8">I remembered this from <i class="calibre5">Restunni</i>, never how fear or look away.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Ali’ Superiore, Sicilia.</i>” I say, proudly, and looking him square in the face. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Sicilianu</i>. <i class="calibre5">Bene, bene</i>,” he said, and he walked with us, always a few feet from the line.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are almost <i class="calibre5">pisani</i>,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Pisani</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si</i>. I come from <i class="calibre5">San Nicole</i>, north and west of you. Not ten miles from <i class="calibre5">Ali</i>’” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">San Nicole</i>?” I scratch my chin, wondering if I should I tell him my business? </p>
<p id="page_714" class="calibre6">“Si, I have been there. Working the peach orchards for one summer, with my zio <i class="calibre5">Pietro</i> and his sons, my cugini.” The cop gives me his hand. What do I do? Wet and greasy. I turned away and wiped on my pants, but still moving with the line. I worried if I refused his hand, I would piss him off and end up in an American prison. What did I know?  I took his hand.          </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Peaches, you say. <i class="calibre5">Mama mia</i>!” He smiled and no longer look so much the cop, but a regular man. Nearly.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I worked the same orchards. Twelve, fourteen hours a day when I was able…I still hate the smell of peaches.”  Si, I hate peached, too, since I almost took a beating for dumping a crate and bruising a few.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You travel with friends?” he asked. “Friends are good. <i class="calibre5">Benvenuti in America</i>.”      </p>
<p class="calibre6">I wonder why was I worthy of this honor, with all these lines and all these men, why did he pick me? It was Conte, I think. This cop saw me with him, and now I am marked, but barely  through the front door. Shit. This is Luca’s fault, and his goddamned broken pistol, now the cops say was not worth a pound of rusted nails.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You remind me of someone,” this cop says. “<i class="calibre5">Si</i>. Yes. My brother, Giuseppe, God rest his soul,” and he bowed his head and made the sign of the cross.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But now he is dead.” He asks, as if I know him all my life, “how is it possible to miss another person as much as I miss him?” I shrug. What do I know? </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I miss him more than I miss my mother and father, I am ashamed to say.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The line stopped quick, and we stood near eye to eye, but he was taller than me by one or two inches, and a few years older, but in good shape, better shape than me. Closer and now he looked more like a cop, and I was uncomfortable that we were talking alone, no witnesses. What would the others say, especially Luca, who has always hated cops?   </p>
<p id="page_715" class="calibre6"> “You will be here a while,” he said. “The inspectors. Most of them are sick. The flu. But no one has died yet, thank God. A few of the nurses and a doctor, are sick, I think.”  He gave me his hand again, and, for what reason, I was glad to shake it (my hand was dry). His grip was firm, strong and steady, and he smiled right at me, making his point, that I should have taken his hand the first time he offered. How did this cop get such a grip, like a vice machine? Cops in Sicilia are soft, some like women.  As I see it, what does he do all day but guard harmless men and women in a line, watching them drag their bags along the floor, praying to be left alone. A job for a monkey, papa said it many times, but papa did not like cops; he said they were all in the back pocket of the landowners (<i class="calibre5">capu</i>).    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He called himself <i class="calibre5">Natale Fuscolo</i>, son of <i class="calibre5">Enrico Fuscolo</i>, who brought his family from Sicilia. Natale was nine years old, he said, and even at that age he realized how different America would be for them. The family went to New Orleans, in the south of America (like Sicilia is in the south of Italia). His papa, his older brothers and a sister, worked the sugar cane fields, twelve hours a day, sometimes for a dollar between them. Natale worked when he could, but he was sickened by the bad water back in Sicilia, and his energy was gone after a few minutes in the fields, worn-out by the brutal sun. What little his family earned bought food, but never enough for clothes, or rent, and they were always behind, a month, sometimes two or three months. His father was a great man, the cop said twice, always making light of their troubles, telling jokes that made them laugh, and this kept the family going, along with, and most of all, their mother’s love.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A great woman,” he said. “We came first, then papa, and mama were last, always last.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">When food was short, when they had little, his father would say, “From now on we will not waste our time eating every day…every other day makes more sense.”    </p>
<p id="page_716" class="calibre6">No clothes to wear, or a place to sleep.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then we eat every other day, and we sleep bare ass in the woods if we must.” His mother scolded his father for the vulgar talk, and he would apologize and drink no more wine that night. <i class="calibre5">Natale Fuscolo</i>, this cop I speak of, believed his father and another man, raided the wine barrels owned by an Americano capu from Napoli, in the middle of the night. He never faulted his father, as he was dying slowly from disease and had no other pleasures.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My mother and father were cheap labor. Nothing more. Cheap labor is why they allowed us here, and we lined the pockets of the rich Americans. But cheap, or not, we were ‘wops’ and ‘dagos’ and ‘grease balls,’ when the crops were in, until the next planting. Have you heard these eloquent words?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Eloquent?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. <i class="calibre5">Eloquente</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have not,” I said.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You will hear them, many times ver. Maybe before you leave this Island.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He followed me along the line, complaining about his family’s treatment in America.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The field bosses, the men hired to push; they were all <i class="calibre5">Americani</i>, not a boss from <i class="calibre5">Italia </i>or <i class="calibre5">Sicilia</i>, and these <i class="calibre5">Americani</i> were as bad as any boss in the <i class="calibre5">old country</i> .” He looked over his shoulder, and down the line.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Old country? I never heard <i class="calibre5">Italia</i> called  <i class="calibre5">il vecchio paese</i> before, but it made sense. Until the day he died, his father regretted leaving the “old country,” believing he only traded chains, and he apologized to his family, many times over.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">He had a nice job, this cop. Did he see it the same way?  </p>
<p id="page_717" class="calibre6">“We survived the best we could, until the day it all went bad. The ‘final straw’ as Americans say.” The cop tells this story (I believe I heard it before) about a mob of drunken men, who dragged a dozen <i class="calibre5">Siciliani</i> into the street and hung them dead, for killing the police chief, though they were found innocent the day before. It was the same story <i class="calibre5">*Gennaro Fiorini</i> told us on the beach, but then I believed Fiorini was full of shit. Maybe not. Two men telling the same story, four thousand miles apart.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“There was discontent and riotous behavior, everywhere,” he said, claiming he remembered the day like it was yesterday. His mother locked the front door, and they never left the house for days. His papa carried a pistol, swearing he would use it against anyone who would try to harm his family. They hid out for near a month, and with no work they fell behind even more and a neighbor said the landlord was going to throw them all out in the street. His father’s dream to go north was near dead. The cop moved closer to the line, and he seemed nervous and jittery. I guessed he was worried about his superiors, the bosses; was he fucking off?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“After the hangings, these bastards were inspired to hunt us down like game birds. My father was on edge for days, arguing with the overseer over back wages he was due. Two men swore his father threatened the overseer with his pistol, that he was a troublemaker and a radical. It was false, a lie, and I will square up with men before I die. My father decided we would leave, go back to Sicilia, but my mother would not have it. Her children had no future in Sicilia, and she insisted we stay, and my father could never deny this wonderful woman.” He smiled when he talked about his mother, but who does not? “She was a strong Sicilian woman…and only a crazy man would argue with this wonderful woman…she refused to leave…what could my father do?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">A strong Sicilian woman</i>,” he says. Every man I have ever know has said his mother was a “strong Sicilian woman.”  If there is another kind of Sicilian woman, I have not seen her.          </p>
<p id="page_718" class="calibre6">“Papa’s brother, my uncle, said there was work in New York, where we are today, so we left New Orleans, first by open wagon, then a train to Washington, all on borrowed money. We slept two nights in an abandoned building when the money ran out. Papa and my brothers worked two days shoveling snow, no coats or gloves, but the same clothes on their backs they wore in New Orleans. Mama gave up her cherished set of silver mirrors, and willingly, she always said, so we could eat. Papa sold her treasured mirrors to a man in a suit and a tie, as a gift to his wife, in return for <i class="calibre5">due scudi. </i>Enough to get us to New York.” The mirrors, as I guessed, was a gift to his mother on the day she married, once belonging to her mother and her grandmother, both dead and buried in Sicilia. His father held his right hand to God and promised he knew the man’s name, where he lived, and would reclaim the mirrors when he had the money. His mama smiled, saying what a wonderful man God had blessed her with, knowing she would never see the mirrors again.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“That night I hear her cry, and when I asked if she cried because of the mirrors, ‘I have a cold,’ she said. ‘Just a cold.’ She would have given her life to get us here. Papa and his brother, <i class="calibre5">*Alfredo</i>, hired out on the railroad, the Central, as I did when I turned sixteen.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And the mirrors?” I asked.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He smiled. “What do you think?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I did not want to say, or offer an opinion, so I change the subject.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I inquired about his grip, how he earned it, and did all the men in his family have it?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Laying rail,” he said, proudly. “Hundreds of miles of rail, from here to Chicago.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">His father was <i class="calibre5">Siclianu</i>, his mother Calabrese from <i class="calibre5">Vinco</i>, high in the hills. He knew nothing about their lives before he was born. How they met and married, such different people, he has no idea and now he is sorry he did not ask when they were still alive,  and among his great regrets, this is the greatest; things he wanted to know, and should know, but never asked.  </p>
<p id="page_719" class="calibre6">“Mama died when I was thirteen, papa two years later.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">In school he spoke English, and English in the neighborhood, but <i class="calibre5">Siclianu</i> and <i class="calibre5">Calabrese</i> at home. When he joined the cops they sent him here, to the Island, because he could speak three languages. He wanted to chase criminals, even <i class="calibre5">Siclianu</i> criminals, “as they smear us all,” he said, “like the cavone who got his due on the dock…did you know him?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Know him? No. No, of course not, but we see what happened. He seemed a violent and shameless man…we mind our own business…we want to be good Americans if they will have us.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He nodded that he understood. “They will have you, with open arms. You work cheap and you never complain. I see it in your eyes. You and your friends are like Christmas presents to these people.” I presented Enzo to Natale, and they greeted each other and for a time they spoke in English, and for that time I was left out, but I cleared my throat and they understood, and spoke Sicilianu, again.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The world, here, is different than you and your friends know. Maybe you will not like America. Many go back. In the old country, in Sicilia, everyone is the same, except for the few rich who can afford to be different. But here? Everyman is different. One man is day, and the next man is night. ‘Day and night,’ is an American expression.”  Then he said it and I have never forgot it, “In this country, my friends, remember this, always walk with two feet in one shoe.”  I asked what this meant, and he smiled. “You will know soon enough. Two feet in one shoe. <i class="calibre5">Ricordi</i>, my friend.”  What he said sounded familiar, maybe a Sicilian saying, or a proverb.  </p>
<p id="page_720" class="calibre6">Enzo explained, ‘two feet in one shoe.’ “One foot at a time, careful and cautious, never looking to the side, but straight head, and most of all…”  He put his finger to his mouth. “Say nothing to anyone.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Mind your business, and this I understood.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The line began to move, but <i class="calibre5">*Natale Fuscolo</i> stayed put, and gave a small salute, as I walked away. “<i class="calibre5">Arrivaderci</i> ,” he said, “and <i class="calibre5">buona fortuna</i>.” I hoped to meet him again, but it would not happen, as these things never happen.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The long lines and straight rows, of immigrant men and women was “inspiring” Enzo said, but I could not see it; like breadlines, I thought, but maybe not. Inspectors, like in Napoli, sitting on high back chairs, behind an open book, looking down at the man or the woman, who stood before him, hat in hand, shivering with fear. I have always lived, ‘hat in hand.’  <i class="calibre5">America. Sicilia</i>. Always “hat in hand.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was my turn.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The inspector’s hand came across the desk.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Passport,” he said, his voice deep and meant to bring fear to anyone standing in front of him. I sweated like a pig, though the doors were open, and the great room was cold, and the wind swirled across the floor, kicking dirt into my eyes.  I dug for my passport, that was inside of my poke, but I could not find it. I smiled at the inspector. “<i class="calibre5">Scusa, signuri, scusa</i> .” He was angry, I could tell. I found it in my back pocket, sitting in a tear, ready to fall through, and in that case, I would have been out of luck. Sent back, for certain. I wiped it off (my passport) and handed it across his desk; as I recall, my hand shook, and I felt less than a man at that moment.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">What I noticed about him, this inspector, he was old; strange, I always believed no <i class="calibre5">Americani</i> worked when he was old.  He wore <i class="calibre5">occhiali</i>, eyeglasses, that kept slipping off the bridge of his nose. This give to him a foolish look, that he was a weak man and I felt better. </p>
<p id="page_721" class="calibre6">He looked and me and thought nothing, but cleared his throat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Where are you from?   </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Destination?(where are you going?)   </i></p>

<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Have you been in America before?   </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Do you slouch or stoop, now, or have you ever slouched or stooped? </i></p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">If you have never slouched, or stooped, will you slouch or stoop if let in?</i></p>
<p class="calibre6">The last two questions he never asked, but if he did, I would have lied my soul into hell.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Slouch? Stoop?  Me? Are you talking to me? I would die first.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Do you have money, and how much money do you have?   </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">“I soldi parlano,” money talks, everywhere. I was slow to answer. “Well, do you?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si,” I said, but he did not ask to see it, thank God. Twenty-five American dollars is what I needed to be an American. I had, maybe, <i class="calibre5">cinque scudi</i>. Five bucks, no more. If he demands to see it, I am out on my ass. We have no money in Sicilia, or only a few have money, so it is more important than air, and everyone wants to see it, if you say you have it. The old men in the piazza always say about America, ‘The streets are paved with gold.’ What fool believes it? Gold in the streets? Thieves would pick it clean in a minute. Some believed it or said they did, but I did not.  Never. If I had twenty-five dollars, I would not be here.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">This man staring me in the eye, was an angry old man, lording over me from his perch in the tree, like a hungry cat. My shirt was soaked in sweat. I shook, trembled like a sick man with the fever; I shit my pants, of course. Did I have to say it? I would have left, then and there, and gone home, but I was penniless and what was my way out except to run, and when is running honorable?     </p>
<p id="page_722" class="calibre6">“You cannot be a public charge,” he said, this stern old man, like a field boss, like every field boss, who are hard men by nature, forgiving nothing, not the slight wrong.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well,” then he paused, “do you have any money? How much do you have?” He looked down at his book. “Mr. Spar…Sparkino?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He tapped his pencil, this impatient man, and I was nervous, and he asked again. I nodded and patted the pockets on my jacket, that were mostly empty. I turn to <i class="calibre5">Enzo Baneri</i>, also nervous and sweating; two pigs going to slaughter, by their own free will. Enzo struggled to loosen his collar, though the room was damp and cold.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The inspector asks me again, and from his tone I believed it was the last time.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Harsh. Very harsh.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">“Do you have twenty-five dollars?”</i> I did not answer him right off. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you have it? Twenty-five dollars?” He was annoyed, I see. </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">“If you do not have twenty-five dollars, you may not enter the United States.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo cleared his throat. <i class="calibre5">“</i>Excuse me, sir. I can vouch that Mr. Sparacino has twenty-five dollars. In fact, I now recall he has given it to me for safe keeping,” at which time he pulled money from his poke and the inspector glanced at it and ordered Enzo to “put it away.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The inspector turned to his side and laughed and made some joke I could not understand, but Enzo smiled.  The old man cursed, and struggled to get his glasses to stay on his nose. We breathed easy, me and Enzo and I was always and forever in his debt.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I had lied. <i class="calibre5">Restunni</i> said it was the best thing to do. This is my excuse.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He hands me back my passport.  </p>
<p id="page_723" class="calibre6">I wonder now, should I have told him it was Enzo’s money, but I would gladly return and show him twenty-five when I have earned it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A shabby looking bastard in the next line was staring a hole through me. I believe he sat with Silvio on the boat, or maybe he was in our cabin, but I did not like his look. Was he an informer? Some guard nudged me from behind, in the small of my back, with the tip of his stick he used like a bayonet.  “Move on,” he said, “follow the men ahead of you.” Enzo bowed, as if greeting <i class="calibre5">Victor Emmanuel</i>, himself </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Certainly,” Enzo said, politely. “We do not want to be any trouble.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Good,” was his reply. “Move it along. The tunnel for medical inspection,” he said, and I heard him clearly, and he spoke with some accent, not Americano, as I could tell. Enzo said he was <i class="calibre5">Irlandese</i> (Irish).  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">L</i>’<i class="calibre5">Irlandese</i> are whiskey drinkers. No taste for wine.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">They must be strange people. Was it my business?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">A fresh painted sign, red letters against white, hung on the wall, but not level and it was annoying to look at. I liked the smell of fresh paint, the linseed oil was soothing, pleasant to the nose. I painted in the army and hated it, but it is  where I learned to love the smell of linseed oil.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are going to Medical Inspection,” Enzo said, but I was not worried for me or Luca, but Enzo and Santo. Enzo is an old man and the army rejected Santo, as his heart is bad. Santo was always a lucky man.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">The room was too small for all the chairs; they were scattered about and stacked in the corners, not clean or an orderly, as I expected of a place where doctors worked.  But I hear music to my ears, not Caruso as I came to love him, but two nurses speaking <i class="calibre5">Sicilianu</i>. Sicilian women? I should have known by their fine look and beautiful eyes, green eyes, like Carmela. My eyes watered. I feared I would weep in front of other men.   </p>
<p id="page_724" class="calibre6">A nurse looks up from the table. “<i class="calibre5">Vienne qua</i> ,” she said, waving us in.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Take off your clothes. Sit by the wall and wait for the doctor.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">She was clean in her white and crisp uniform, but her <i class="calibre5">Sicilianu</i> was not that good to the ear, but close enough that I could understand what she said. She was <i class="calibre5">Italiana</i>, but not <i class="calibre5">Sicilianu, </i>as I first thought. Still a beauty. Not a man moved, or unbuttoned a button, and she was embarrassed and corrected herself,  “I am sorry…your shirts…your shirts, only,” and she said it in English and repeated it in better <i class="calibre5">Sicilianu, </i>that made some sense to all of us. Two doctors come in the room and smiled at the nurses, with the beautiful olive skin, and they turned and hid their faces that were turning red. Luca sees Enzo staring; he whispers in his ear, “how long has it been, my friend?” The answer would be ‘not long,’ if Enzo counted the saloon women where he played cards. Si. He paid them in Lire and wine, but I am certain it still counts.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">There was so much shuffling of feet. Who would be the first man to strip off his shirt, and we looked at each other and no one moved?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Per favore</i>,” the one nurse said, and apologized for her ‘poor’ Sicilian. Such beautiful green eyes. I thought of Carmela, once more, and what a fine nurse she would be and maybe she could study and be a nurse, when she comes to America. The last man in the line was not one of us, but from another country and a nurse took his arm and pointed to us, that we had removed our shirts, and she made these ‘taking off” gestures that he understood. We were naked from the waist up, shivering, including Enzo, who was in poor shape, even for a man his age. He was embarrassed for himself, crossing his arms in front of his chest, figuring no one would notice that everything was sagging bad, toward the floor. Enzo would not make it in the fields, but he reads and writes and is a good teacher, so what did he care? But in a way I felt superior to him, that he was physically a poor man, but then I think, ‘what sane man would want to do bull work, like animals do and <i class="calibre5">contadini</i>?’  </p>
<p id="page_725" class="calibre6">Now two more nurses; one young and attractive, the other, well, older and looked to be a well-worn matron, but clean. ‘Clean’ is a good quality for a woman. Four school trained women in one room. Has it happened before? Three were attractive women, good for the eyes, but it did no good to ease my shame, as I was embarrassed to be standing half-naked, a dirt farmer, in front of strange women. They talked while they worked, like busy work; they waited for the doctors to give orders, and until then we waited. One doctor crushed his cigar on the floor and sighed heavy.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Let’s get on with this group. It is going to be a long day today…they say a record…my God, where do they all come from?” He coughed. He looked sick. “They should have another place to send some of these people, or they should learn some English before they get here. Always interpreting…it takes forever to do the smallest examination.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">This doctor looks me straight in the eye. “<i class="calibre5">Parle Ingelese</i>!” he asks, in terrible <i class="calibre5">Italiano. </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">I shrug, no. When he seemed disgusted, I worried.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He listens to my chest. I made an honest mistake, meaning no disrespect; I talked to the man behind me. “Sta zita,” this nurse said. A matron. I am certain of it. Si. Yes, a matron, of course, I was embarrassed being corrected by a woman, this I freely admit, but my eyes and ears were clean, and thank God for that.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Send him on,” this doctor says. I did not like his foul tone and the way he shook his head. The matron who yelled at me (I believed she was a boss) took my papers and passed them to the second doctor, who wiped his hands on a towel hanging from a post. He never looked up, or acknowledged me, except to say, “drop your pants,” and at his order I took them down and waited during this indignity, while he checked me <i class="calibre5">there</i> for disease, and other maladies. It was the same as in the army, but these nurses never looked away. This checking of things I did not mind, except four women, not blood relatives, were in the room when it happened. When he finished down there, he listens to my heart like the first doctor, moving the tube here and there, changing the spot three, four times, across my chest. Enzo said later, the doctor must have thought there was a problem with my heart, else why would two doctors listen to the same beat. Would it change in ten feet?   </p>
<p id="page_726" class="calibre6">They give Santo a going over. This worried me. If they kicked him out, would I go back with him, or leave him to his own?  His hands shook, bad, as he used one to calm the other, but in any case, I was embarrassed for him. He is a good friend, and I did not want to see him rejected and humiliated. What would he say back home? The nurse writes in a book, never looking Santo in the eyes, and this worried me, as it means bad news, or it does most of the time.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The doctor clears his throat.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tell him he has a murmur...his heart is leaking blood.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">The nurse nodded, obediently. She looked Santo straight in the eyes.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Lei ha un soffio al cuore. Il tuo cuore sta perdendo sangue.</i>”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Inform him I do not know how bad it is. He must see a heart doctor.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Il medico non sa come è fatto male. È necessario conultare un medico cuore</i>” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo looks at me, not sorrowfully, as he heard it before, and this malady has served him well, keeping his out of the goddamned army.  Enzo stepped in and spoke for Santo.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Excuse me, doctor. My friend, *<i class="calibre5">Santo Sparacino</i>. Will he be denied admittance because of this condition?”  </p>
<p id="page_727" class="calibre6">The doctor curled his chin.  </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Your English is excellent,” he says to Enzo.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Thank you, doctor.  I am a teacher; I have taught in England for many years.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Welcome to America,” the doctor said. “As to your friend…he will not be denied. There is no reason to send him home. But he should see a doctor as soon as possible.” He glances at the shirtless immigrants.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I know these men do not trust doctors, but…”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will bring him myself,” Enzo said. “I promise you…if I have to drag him.” Enzo bowed at the waist. “Grazie, thank you. And may I say your Italian is likewise very good.” He lied. It was <i class="calibre5">not</i> good, but the lie was honest and respectable, as I could tell. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca passed the test, easy, and this did not surprise me as he was the only man in the room with good arms and a firm chest. Even of the fruit pickers, who were always reaching and stretching, but never turning the soil with heavy shovels. And Enzo, to my surprise, for all his sagging flesh, had no trouble. He accounted this to good parents, who lived long lives, and were mostly healthy. “Breeding,” he said, “tells most of the story.” I thought he was full of shit. When your time is up, how does it matter who your father was?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">We moved on to the last nurse in line, and like the rest, she never raised her eyes to us, but held our papers over her head, and we grab them as we left the room. A cop at the door waved us on to another cop, sitting at a desk, cursing his match as he tried to light a stub of a cigar. He took my papers, from the doctors, the nurses, the inspectors, and looked them over, close, and without ceremony he stamped my passport. Enzo r3ad the words. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Admitted,” it said. Nothing else. No “<i class="calibre5">Benvenuti in America</i>.” No nothing. Visitors I would have greeted with enthusiasm, even if he was a beggar looking for a handout. To hell with them, I thought. I will make my own way. When have I needed strangers to kiss my ass, or say how wonderful it is to have me? To hell with them all, but I admit I waited for this day to sink into my Sicilian head, for my blood to start boiling, but no, nothing. I felt no different. I was still me, and on my own, but in a different place. I am in. I am here. <i class="calibre5">Sono qui</i>.  </p>
<p id="page_728" class="calibre6">What did <i class="calibre5">Restunni</i> say? Never slouch or stoop over, or complain on aches or pains?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I took Enzo by the arm. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are we Americans, yet?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was a joke, but Enzo, a serious man did not like a good joke, as I could tell.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are who we are, Antonino…we will never be Americani.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The day was, by any measure of things, a great day for me; but did I jump up and down, or slap my friends on the back, or drink until I passed out and fell on my face? Many did. I did not. The great days I count on three fingers of my left hand. The first day was the day they released me from the army, told to get home the best way I could.  No thanks. No pat on the back. The second great day, I meet Carmela in the field shack, and this day is the third day, and I hope and pray not the last great day. Why was I not excited? Maybe I worried this is all it will be, a statue in the bay and nothing more, or more of the same. I give my hand to the cop, as I had expected some gesture of welcome, as I know the Americani did not embrace as we do in Sicilia, but he shrugged me off and pointed to the door, then turned away. I took this embarrassment like a man, as I thanked him for his hospitality to this point, and his fair treatment and the fair treatment of his countrymen. I do not believe Enzo was comfortable translating my words, but I was certain he did what I asked him to do.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">We moved on as we were told, for this is what we do.     </p>
<p id="page_729" class="calibre6">It was not a joyous day for every man and woman, who made it to the door, as some were no better off and had the same misery as when they were in Italia, or from wherever they came.  A ragged looking Italiano, holding on dearly to a small bag with a rip on the side, and speaking in some <i class="calibre5">Calabrian</i> dialect I barely understood, was protesting on the terrible mistake that was made against him, while two rough looking cops took him away, like a side of beef being pulled across the floor. His woman cried and pleaded and carried on, saying he had done nothing wrong, but she was pushed aside and ignored, as her man disappeared down a long hall. He came on our boat, Enzo thought, but he was not familiar to me, or was she, but I felt bad for their troubles. The frantic woman stood alone, in the middle of this huge room, with a thousand people, and cried.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What has he done,” she wailed, over and over again, but no one answered her. When he was gone(he never fought back or talked back)she leaned against one of the heavy wooden columns, then slipped to the floor, cursing the cops for what they did, and her husband for leaving her alone. We were sorry for her trouble, but what could we do but mind our business and go on as if we saw nothing. I have said it before, that to mind my business, this I learned as a child in <i class="calibre5">Sicilia</i>, and I saw no reason to change because I was in America.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">The exit was a double door; solid, made of thick iron, that took two men to open if it was closed. Luca tried alone and failed, owing it to the “rusted hinges,” but we pushed, then pulled, and when the door opened, there was a piazza, bigger and grander than any piazza I had seen. I recall staring until my eyes were sore, and Enzo said he talked to me, but I never heard him. I will never forget, for it is still burned in my mind, the sight of hundreds, maybe thousands, of men and women and their children, dragging bags across the cobblestone, to this great gate that led to America. Enzo called me a sentimental man. We moved away from the building and joined the others, in a hurry to get distance between us and some <i class="calibre5">cavone</i> who might decide to send us back because this was not right, or that was not right, or some mark was here and should have been there. Shit. All of it.  </p>
<p id="page_730" class="calibre6">I felt joy and fear at the same time, and this has never made sense to me; to be honest it was more fear I felt. My stomach burned from the turmoil in it, as if a million little men were in me, stoking a fire. The toilet? I needed a toilet, but there were no toilets I could see. Enzo asked a guard, who was flipping his stick, and not all that interested.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Scusa</i>, signore…where might we find a toilet for my friend?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Inside,” he said. “You have to go back inside,” and when Enzo said this, I decided I would hold it, and never go back inside, unless dragged. I am out here, now. I will stay out here until I find a way off the Island. I have shit my pants before.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Quello che sarà, sarà</i>,” what will happen, will happen, is wisdom from my mother, though I do not believe it was her wisdom, maybe her mother’s wisdom, or her fathers.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was a cold day, even for marzo, so they said, but for me it was not too bad. I thought I see snow across the piazza; maybe not. The sky was turning blue, and the clouds disappeared. The sun was bright, and my eyes hurt if I stared on it straight, but what a good feeling, even the pain, after two or three weeks below the water line. Santo wondered if he would ever get used to the cold and the snow, but who would not give up a few warm days for a better life?  Only a fool.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">They tell us, “Find the ferry,”  as it will take us off the Island, to the city across the river, and then we will be on our own. Si, I was <i class="calibre5">spaventato</i>, frightened, like a woman and I felt shame for this.     </p>
<p id="page_731" class="calibre6">Enzo will leave us, I believe, but we have not talked about his plans. God help us. He has been like kin to me, but he has his own life, and must find his brother wherever he is. I hope we will meet again and talk about the days we shared.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Noi siamo qui, finalmente.</i>” We are here at last. </p>
<p class="calibre6">I went on, like I was told, but my legs were tired and weak, and I feel being feeble for the first time in my life, like and old man, struggling to walk a straight line (I hoped I did not catch Santo’s bad heart). The sweat was dripping down face, even as we walked against the cold wind. I see a cop standing flat against the brick wall, rubbing the handle of the revolver strapped to his side. When he saw us coming, he twisted the end of his thick and black mustache and nodded, not waiting for Enzo to ask his question.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Follow the lines,” the cop says, pointing left with his stick, “And look for the gate.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Andate a sinistra</i>,” he said in bad <i class="calibre5">Italiano</i>, and no wonder, his hair was fire red. </p>
<p class="calibre6">With some luck and the grace of God we found the short line, that was moving at a good clip. I fall in behind an old man who limped when he walked. After a few steps he stopped to cinch the straps on his pack, and he joked it was his home and his home kept slipping down his back. I helped him and he thanked me, so politely I was embarrassed for him and me. He said  he traveled alone from a village near Catania, to find his only brother so they could spend their last days together. In front of him, to my surprise, was Assunta, from <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi</i>, dragging her bag along the ground. By the look of her face, all red and swollen, I believe she had been crying, or was about to cry. She asked Enzo, what should she do if her brother Enrico,  and his friend, Bernardo, did not show, or they were lost, or decided not to come (she had not seen him since she was a child). His letter to the priest said the docking time of our ship would be printed in the <i class="calibre5">Giornale</i> (newspaper) and he would come on the streetcar with Bernardo. What would she do if left to her own? I had no answer, nothing to say, but I prayed she was wrong, and her brother will be waiting on the street, but for a feeling in my gut, I did not believe he would come. “Keep with us,” I said, and she nodded and wiped her eyes, and we both felt better. My idea was to ask a cop what she should do, where she should go, if her brother did not come. Ma and watch and wait, maybe pray. Her hands shook, like an old woman, or an infirm woman, and I could not recall a woman so defenseless and helpless, in my life.  </p>
<p id="page_732" class="calibre6">“Stay close to me,” I said, and she did, though I did not offer to carry her bag, but for some reason but I felt responsible for this girl I barely knew. This, maybe, was my flaw. Enzo said there were millions of people in this city, no chance we would find him if he did not want to be found. Where did he live? How would she get back home?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The wind changed, now from the south; we smelled horse, and for what reason I thought of <i class="calibre5">*Signore Gazarello’s</i> two great draught mares, that ate, and shit more than they worked, but he loved them both, swearing they were like a part of his family. This I could not understand. Two animals are family? Two horses? A pathetic man, but I liked him and respected him, as he was a good friend to my father. Near hidden by the shadows, two cops sat high and proud on browns, watching the line of men and women struggle with their children, dragging all they owned in a bag, maybe two. Watching us, Luca said. How are we men who deserve to be watched, like criminals? We are nothing but nervous and frightened, and women with children, who worry they will never see their family again. Then I hear yelling and uproar and my heart began to beat like a loud drum. The line stopped, sudden, and a thousand tired feet were frozen to the cobblestones (there were fifty, or so, in our line).  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I am curious, on the why of things, but not interested in another man’s explanation, so I step out of line to see for myself, for a better look and I saw him, a big man near the gate, who was tall, a head taller than me, angry face and vicious eyes, sunk deep in his skull. He rubbed the handle of this thick club he carried at his side, taking some pleasure in the feel of it. The boat  was behind him, through the gate he guarded, with twenty men who blocked our way. Maybe more. I could not tell, or I was afraid to take another look. He was their leader and without warning he charged at our line, swinging this club around his head, beating the cold air, and cursing like a crazy man. He stopped his frenzy, and pointed the club to the cold, blue water; the wind changed direction and calmed, like some sign, that he would be heard. He was broad and muscular and stood, his feet wide apart, threatening, and I admit the look of it made me nervous. He took some pleasure in the physical things, like screaming to threaten other men, even women. I admit he looked tougher than Luca looked. Like Conte, he was a commanding man, but his knees were not broken in pieces like Conte’s, and he was younger and not well dressed, but he could scream to wake the dead.  </p>
<p id="page_733" class="calibre6">“Go back, all you bastards…where you come from and die. You are not like us, and not welcomed here.” The men behind him cheered, as they closed ranks. It was what they said, and the back slapping that bothered me . Wops and dago’s. all of us; that’s what they said, even to the women and children. The words needed no translating; I heard them on the boat from the german crew, and from other men, not <i class="calibre5">Italiano</i>. Their shrill voices, the insults, echoed from the buildings, mixing with the wind. This anger, I have not forgotten, and I hear it every day, from that day. A young woman, a mother, afraid of what she saw. pulled a child tight to her side.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Che sta dicendo. </i>Will they kill us?” she pleads of Enzo, who shook his head. “What have we done to them?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They just do not want us here,” he answered. She grabbed his sleeve, but he pulled away. I saw terror in her face, and she cried, her child cried.   </p>
<p id="page_734" class="calibre6">“Where will we go if they make us leave?” Enzo never answered but shook his head. She took the boy and disappeared in the crowd.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The big man, with the big mouth, came close to our line, dragging his club across the cobblestones, laughing how the devil must laugh. He inspected each man, each woman, as he passed where were we stood, and when he stopped, he stopped in front of me, and I see in the squint of his eye, the love of battle. I thought, thank God, he is not a heathen, as I see the sun reflect off the gold crucifix he wore around his neck. I relaxed at the sight of the symbol of Christ he wore, but with no warning he ran his club into my ribs, like a bayonet. The people behind me screamed. <i class="calibre5">Assunta </i>from Colleberardi, cried out, “<i class="calibre5">Lascialo solo,</i>” leave him alone.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why me,” I asked as I fell to the ground, and taking down the old man who carried the house on his back. My grandfather’s vines fell from the case, scattering in all directions. Keep the vines in sight, I was thinking when my head hit stones. I moaned, I was groggy, but not hurt. Sicilian heads are hard, thank God, like the cobblestone. Santo gives me a hand up, I slip and went down again. Luca screamed, like a crazy man, that we should fight, and he moves toward this sonofabitch, ready to confront him alone. <i class="calibre5">Assunta</i> looks down at me, where I lay on the cobblestone. “<span class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Sei ferito? </i></span><span class="calibre15">(are you hurt),</span> <span class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">” </i></span><span class="calibre15">she asks, frightened and out breath. </span>I tell her stand back, away from the cavones, and she did. I clenched my firsts so hard the fingers turned white and lost all feeling. I looked for the cops on their horses and I knew this crazy bastard was not done with me. When he cocked his club for another run, I thought better of fighting, of giving him a head to beat, certain he would and enjoy himself. I back away, out of club range, and put out my hand to start the peace; maybe foolishly. He laughed; he was defiant. Luca curses the big man then lunged, but I pulled him back to the line, holding on as hard as I could, while he screamed, that he wanted to fight.  “No more Conte’s,” he yells, and we understood what he meant. Enzo settled him down and they moved away from the front, while this crazy bastard, laughed and taunted, as the men behind him screamed, and the cops looked away, and talked among themselves. </p>
<p id="page_735" class="calibre6">It is a nice day, today. </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Si</i>, it is, but tomorrow it is supposed to rain.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">As to this crazy sonofabitch, he screamed and carried on. “You are parasites<i class="calibre5"> (parassiti)</i>,” as he struck his club on the ground. When he tired, he stopped and pointed it at our line.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Siete tutti parassiti</i>,” he said (his Italiano was pretty good). “You are parasites.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">When he finished his rant, this man with a crucifix, he runs back to his line and mixed in with the others. Five horse cops finally move in, between us and them. I believed this was the end of the violence, but no, the cops were not tough, and these bastards cursed (there were women and children in the line). The cops were impatient, saying they wanted to leave, and when they pulled back six of these sonofabitches moved towards us, still led by the man who proudly wore his crucifix around his neck. We stayed our ground, mostly, but the older men and the women and their children moved back, fearing the violence. Who would protect us if we went forward? The American cops? What fool, except a rich fools would trust the cops. Not us. One of the six men, short and fat, raised a fist to a straggler, a woman he had cornered, but a horse cop came and chased him away, but the horse kicked up, knocking the women down (I do not believe on purpose). She lay still on the cobblestones, crying and holding her head, but I believe she was not hurt all that much, as there was no blood to be seen. Her husband gave chase to this bastard who cornered his wife, but the horse cop cut him off, and we see he laughed at getting away. Her bag split open, and what she carried scattered across the cobblestone. We pick her up and gathered her goods, but she limped when she walked. Her husband spoke some English, but poorly, as Enzo could tell. She pleaded to her man, “take me home,” but he held her hand and stoked her hair, saying they had no home.   </p>
<p id="page_736" class="calibre6">She stared with her sorrowful eyes. “I remember,” she said, and began to weep. “We have no home.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A cop, a boss, as I recall he wore gold, told the men at the gate they could not block the way, and he ordered us not to incite them, since this was America and if they did not want us here, they had the right to say so. “Uncivilized,” I thought. The men obeyed, but slowly, taking their time, eyeing each of us before they left, a few mouthing off to the cops that they were traitors to their race. More But more came from nowhere and took their place. These new men, were younger and bigger and louder, and carried shovels and sledgehammers, striking them on the ground in cadence, like a marching army. These protestors were assoles, all of them; they wore the same clothes, work clothes, like me, and their hands and faces were dirty. One man threw his shovel to the side and unfolded an American flag, and the men behind him cheered and carried on. The flag snapped in the wind, and I admit it was a sight, like the green woman; they chanted, called us “wops,” said we should go home, and not dirty their clean country, and cages were too good for us.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">One man carried a sign I believe said the same in bold and red letters.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Wops go home.” He held it high over his head, waving it like a flag.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Wops go home,” he screams, again, looking me straight in the eye.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I made this promise, to me and no one else, that I would never leave this country until I was ready to leave, or they put a gun to my head, and I had no choice. Men like these men, were the men who drove me from my home, and they <i class="calibre5">will not</i> do it again.    </p>
<p id="page_737" class="calibre6">The ferry was setting to leave, and I would be on it, walking or feet first. I start for the gate; my legs shaking, and I near tripped when I caught the heel of my boot on a high stone. At the final gate he met me, this man with the sign, and the cop yelled to him, that he could not block my way. The <i class="calibre5">cavone</i> laughed. Do not embarrass him, I thought; leave him an honorable way out, so he can feel like a man, even if he is not much of a man. I prayed for a peaceful end, as I extended my hand, once more. Slowly, and stuttering, more like a fool, I said, “<i class="calibre5">mi chiamo</i>…my name…my name…<i class="calibre5">Antonino Sparacino</i>…we cannot go back…there is no other place to go.” When I stared at him, what did I see right off?  Like the crazy bastard with the club, this man had a crucifix around his neck, silver, not gold, and I figured he was not a boss. Bosses wear gold, always. What I saw was a hateful man, but still a man. What did he see? Did he see a man?  Not a man, an animal, maybe, not good enough to cage. He refused to speak, or did I see any emotion on his weathered face, except he looked at the cop on the nervous horse, that galloped in place. When I give him my hand, like Americani’s do, he laughed and spits at me, a good one, a hit across my right cheek. I clenched my fists, and my first thought was to punch his face, but what would be the good of it? I wiped his spit off my cheek, and said it again, “<i class="calibre5">mi chiamo Antonino Sparacino</i>…happy I am here.” Someday, maybe, we will meet again and sit on a chair in the park and share a bottle of wine, and maybe he will say why I am his enemy, and maybe I will understand, but probably I will not. I gave him my hand once more, and he refused.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am a proud American,” he yelled into my face. He turned and looked at the men with him.  “Born here like my father and his father, and all these men,” and they applauded, and he smiled and struck his chest in a frenzy.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The wind kicked up. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you hear what I said? I am American,” and they applaud him again.  </p>
<p id="page_738" class="calibre6">He pushed the heavy sign into my face, and when I push back, he was startled and fell off balance. I see the horse cop moving close and of course he saw it but chose to turn away. I could hear myself breathe, the rattling in my chest. This guardian of the gate was making a choice. It seemed a long time when nothing happened, then he spit at my feet, and when he looked up, he looked at <i class="calibre5">Assunta</i>, from <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi</i>, and said of her, in decent Sicilianu, “ <i class="calibre5">puttanu</i>,” whore,” and without thinking I swung the poke filled with my grandfather’s grapes, hitting this bastard square up the side of his head. He fell, hard, and hit the cobblestone hard, and he lay there rubbing his face and cursing me to hell. I stood over him, fists clenched, but to this day, I cannot recall what I said, only that I was angry and babbling. Foolishness, maybe, but I do not think so. Luca was there, next to me, and he grabbed my arm. Luca the peacemaker. Two men picked this rabble off the ground, and the three stood side by side. He took his sign, “Wops Do Not Belong Here,” and broke off the board and stood defiantly with the heavy stick in his hand, that I believe he thought to club me. Luca grabbed my arms, overpowering me with his great strength, and as I struggle, he sends the girl from <i class="calibre5">Colleberardi </i>to the back of the line. She was scared and crying, but she did what she was told, like a good Italian woman. Two rowdies grabbed the bag and spread her clothes over the cobblestone. If this was to be war, then so be it. But the big mouth at the gate was no fool, as I first thought. A few men from our line moved to the front, and the young ones clenched their firsts, but we did not curse, or yell, or threaten. In the end, this crazy bastard did not step aside, but he moved enough that we could fit our way between him and the fence, and toward the ferry. It was a win, of a sort, but he never apologized for insulting this young girl, when he called her <i class="calibre5">puttanu</i>, whore, but I left him a message written to the side of his face; a thick, red welt to remember me (my name on it, <i class="calibre5">Antonino Sparacino</i>) and the rule that a civilized man does not call a young girl “<i class="calibre5">puttanu</i>.” I stopped and starred at this sonofabitch, but Enzo took my arm, telling me in <i class="calibre5">Sicilianu</i>, that I bested this rabble, and it was time to “get to it.”   </p>

<p id="page_739" class="calibre6">I pat at my pockets, took hold of my suitcase, my poke, and stared at the gate. I was like the old man who carried his house on his back; everything I owned was in my pockets or my suitcase or the poke I carried. What did I have? My grandfather’s vines. A worthless pair of worn pants; my father’s shirt; government papers; a few lire to hold me until I found work. There were other things, and I am ashamed to say it, because some will think less of me, but now is too late for me to worry on it. Wrapped in brown paper and hidden at the bottom of my suitcase, the fine pair of leather gloves, and the locket I took from the old capu’s poke when I was alone. I took  the picture from the locket, leaving it in the capu’s suitcase. Carmela still wears the locket and to my shame I have lied to her all these years, swearing I found it on the docks in Napoli. She knows, but she does not know. I refused to leave it for the sailors to fight over, when they found the <i class="calibre5">capu’s</i> suitcase, they would sell it all to buy wine and whores. How could it be right to leave these fine things behind? The gloves? The locket? Later, much later, I confessed to <i class="calibre5">Patri Antonelli</i> (a Sicilian from Palermu) at Our Lady of Pompeii Church, who understood the bad times, but he said it was wrong what I did, and gave me penance; three Hail Mary’s, two Our Fathers and a good Act of Contrition. When I left the church that day, it was late in the afternoon, and I run into a good friend and a good baker, <i class="calibre5">Sig. Leonardo di Piesta</i>, from <i class="calibre5">Itala</i>, in the Sicilian hills. He come across on the same boat, although we did not meet, but this made us brothers.  </p>
