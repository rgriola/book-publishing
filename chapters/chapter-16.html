<h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px; font-style: italic;">A Shared Suffering and the First Storm</h1>

<div class="chapter-body">

    <p>The ship was called the “*Antonio Lopez*,” named after some old man, I guess, who sold his mother for a few *lire*. We sailed, they said, a few minutes before midnight. There was no horn, or loud whistle, as in the movies; only the throb of the engine, and the creaking of the metal walls, and the roar of the water outside, that sounded like a thousand voices screaming at once. We were finally at sea, and it was hard to imagine the ocean in all its fury was only inches away. <em>Enzo</em>, who claimed to be a sailor, said the throbbing was the engine, and the creaking was the ship’s structure being stressed by the pressure of the sea. It was a terrifying sound. We all climbed into our bunks, mostly to escape the bad air, hoping to sleep away the first part of the journey. In my haste, I did not think to pick the top bunk, but I did. I was lucky.</p>
    <p>We sailed out of the harbor, and almost immediately, the ship was bouncing like a cork, not smoothly like a rocking chair, but like a drunkard falling down stairs. There were loud crashes from above and below, and the ship pitched and rolled like a broken toy. The oil lamps in the four corners swung wide, casting moving shadows on the dark green walls, making it impossible to sleep. The sound of the wind, and the water, and the groans of the ship, and the loud crash of things falling on the deck above were mixed together in a terrifying chorus. My heart beat against my ribs like a hammer. I was afraid, but only for a moment, and I knew what was coming. I was not alone.</p>
    <p>Then the screaming started, not the sound of the wind, or the water, but the terrified cries of the women and the children. I tried to calm them, but they were in the grip of fear, and I was not a father, or a husband, so I was ignored. In the dim light, I saw the young woman from <em>Colleberardi</em>, <em>Assunta</em>, still in her corner bunk, silently crying. I wanted to help her, but I could not. I was one of them, but I was not their leader, nor their priest.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Curse of the Sea</h3>

    <p>The real sickness started early, maybe an hour into the voyage. A boy of about ten years, the son of the man from <em>Etna</em>, was the first. He started with a low groan, then a cough, and finally, a violent spasm that launched his stomach’s contents into the air, over the side of his bed, splattering the floor below. His mother screamed, and a chorus of others joined in. The smell, already bad, now became a hundred times worse. The man from <em>Etna</em>, a big man with a thick neck, held his son, wiping his face with a rag, all while crying his own tears. I looked down, and I saw the mess on the floor, and I knew it was only the beginning. The ship lurched, and the young boy vomited again. It was a terrible sight.</p>
    <p>Then came the others: men, women, and children, one by one, succumbing to the violent motion of the sea, unable to keep anything down. The air became thick with the sour stench of vomit, sweat, and the overpowering smell of the privy. The pot filled up almost immediately, and when the ship rolled hard, it spilled onto the floor, mixing with the other filth, creating a river of sickness that flowed back and forth with the ship’s movement. We were drowning in our own bodily fluids.</p>
    <p>I was lucky. I never once felt the urge to vomit, and I was thankful for that. I lay in my bunk, watching the horrors below, wondering if this was the price of <em>America</em>. Was this *Il Purgatorio* (Purgatory) before the promised land? <em>Luca</em>, in the bunk beside me, was pale, his eyes wide with fear, but he did not vomit, either. “I swear, <em>Nino</em>,” he whispered, his voice hoarse, “if I make it to *America*, I will never, ever, step foot on a boat again.”</p>
    <p>“I swear the same thing,” I said, but I knew it was a lie. We would do whatever it took to survive.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">A Battle of Wills</h3>

    <p>The noise from the cabin was unbearable. The crying, the retching, the shouts, and the constant crashing and groaning of the ship. <em>Enzo</em>, who had picked a bunk near the privy, complained bitterly about the smell, though he had not been sick. He covered his face with his blanket, but the stench was everywhere. He tried to speak Latin, but no one listened, and the words were lost in the chaos.</p>
    <p>I saw the man from <em>Etna</em>, still holding his sick son, his face a mask of despair. The boy was weak, his body convulsing. The father looked up at me, his eyes pleading. “Can you help me, <em>signore</em>? Is there a doctor on this ship?”</p>
    <p>“I do not know,” I said. “I will ask the crew when they come.”</p>
    <p>But the crew never came. They had no reason to. We were steerage, and we were forgotten. We were cargo, and they only cared that the cargo did not perish. After a few hours, the man from <em>Etna</em> wrapped his son in a blanket and laid him on the floor, beside the river of sickness. The boy was still breathing, but barely.</p>
    <p>The wind howled, and the ship tilted sharply to the right. A wave crashed against the iron wall, making a sound like a thousand hammers. The oil lamps flickered, almost going out. A woman screamed, convinced the ship was sinking. <em>Luca</em> grabbed my arm, his grip tight. “We are going to die, <em>Nino</em>. We are going to die in this tomb.”</p>
    <p>I forced myself to remain calm. “No, <em>Luca</em>. We are <em>Sparacino</em> and we are *Vincitori* (winners). We will not die here. We will see *America*.” I knew it was a lie, but it was the only thing I could offer him.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic;">The Iron Law of the Sea</h3>

    <p>The captain’s voice, filtered through a metal speaker, suddenly boomed through the passage, warning us to stay in our bunks and not venture onto the decks. The storm, he said in broken <em>Italiano</em>, would last another day. The water was rough, and the danger was great. His words did nothing to calm the fears. If anything, they made them worse.</p>
    <p>I looked down at <em>Assunta</em>, still quietly crying, her blanket drawn tightly around her. She was a ghost in the dim light. I climbed down from my bunk, my feet slipping on the wet, filthy floor. I crawled to her corner, my head brushing the rough wood of the bunks above. I reached out and gently touched her shoulder. She looked up at me, her green eyes wide and filled with tears.</p>
    <p>“*Coraggio* (Courage),” I whispered. “It will be over soon. We are strong.”</p>
    <p>She nodded, a small, fragile movement. I stayed there for a moment, offering what comfort I could, until the smell became too much, and the next wave of nausea swept over the room. I retreated back to my dry, safe, top bunk. I pulled my blanket up to my chin and closed my eyes, trying to block out the sounds and the smells. I knew the voyage had only just begun. The iron law of the sea was simple: suffer in silence, or be thrown to the fish. We were all sharing this first storm, and the shared suffering was the only comfort we had.</p>
