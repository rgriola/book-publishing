<!-- Conte, Criminals, and Cold Truth
Aboard the ship, the men meet Silvio Conte, a violent, powerful man from Palermo who is identified as a dangerous criminal.

<div class="chapter-body">

<p class="calibre4">We watched the city disappear; smaller and smaller, until it was no more than a spot on the horizon. Santo points to the stacks on the ship; three as I recall. spitting foul and filthy black smoke as we moved to the open sea.  He wondered out loud, did the smoke kill the birds, to which we had no answer.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The singing was over, and the blessings were over, and again it was a fearful night, cold and damp and dark, except for a bright moon that once and a while peeked through the clouds. The priest was gone; he had blessed, maybe half the people on the deck, before he went back to his cabin(not First Class, they said, but Second Class. Not steerage. Only Bishops, or better, bought First Class). As the deck cleared, good spaces opened along the rail, and we wanted to stay as long as we could see the glow of the lights on the horizon. I figured Luca would weaken and come up, but no. In no time the clamor was over, the drinking was done, and deck was near empty, save a few men in a group, who I did not recognize. No women or children, only men, drinking wine and laughing, about what, God only knows. I see a group of men, five or six, standing alone near the rail. They laughed and joked and talked too loud. One of the men, the tallest, the best dressed, waved us over. With his thumb cocked back, he points at me, like his hand was a pistol. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You,” he said, in a deep, powerful voice. Intimidating. “Come over for a drink…bring your friends. It’s an order.” He laughed, holding two wine bottles high over his head, shaking them in the wind.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“One drink before they are <i class="calibre5">morte</i>, dead, and there is no more of the good wine.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I thanked him, but no, I said, it was too late for me to drink, then I thanked him again, feeling the fool to turn down wine at a time meant to be joyous. But the pull of free wine was too much for Enzo and Santo; they left me at the railing and joined these strangers, never looking back. I lean on the railing watching the glow from the lights in <i class="calibre5">Napoli</i> fade, fade, and near disappear. At times like this, what was better than being alone, and what did I do when I was alone? I dreamed, this time of Sicilia, my family and Carmela, when pain hit my neck like a jolt, but not from the wind or the cold. I turn and see Santo and a big man, both smiling, but the big man did the talking. Why did he know my name?  </p>
<p id="page_504" class="calibre6">“Antonino…join us for a drink. There are only a few bottles left. Good Sicilian wine, not the shit from Roma.” He held a bottle in each hand. “Or that <i class="calibre5">Neapolitan</i> garbage they sell on the boat. I hear they piss in the bottles.” He laughed like a crazy man, as he pushed a bottle into my chest.  “Good <i class="calibre5">Vinu Siclianu,</i>” he said. It is disrespectful, not manly, to refuse Sicilian wine, on the day we leave home. A drop, or two, maybe half a glass, just to be friendly. I forced a smile, as he slapped my shoulder, but not hard.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, of course. Siclianu wine. How can I say no?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo had a full glass in his hand, but the big man pushed him aside, and the glass tipped spilling wine across the deck. He looks at Santo and forced a smile. “No problem,” he says, but I see his anger at the waste of good wine. He settled down and straightened his jacket and cleared his throat.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mi chiamo</i> *<i class="calibre5">Silvio Conte,” </i>he said, with a wide and proud smile. “From Sicilia, like you and your friends,” and he glanced at Santo, who looked foolish standing there with his empty glass. This <i class="calibre5">Conte’s</i> was a powerful man, and when I shook his hand, it closed around mine, then he squeezed until I flinched and pulled away. He made his point with brutal strength, but I knew he did not earn his power honest, by hard work with pick and shovel, like my father and grandfather. They were honest men.   </p>
<p id="page_505" class="calibre6">He poured wine into a fancy glass (crystal, I believe) spilling not a drop, though the ship rolled, some.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Solo la meta</i>,” I said. “Only half.” He stared from the corner of his eye.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Half?” He laughed, and when Santo saw him laugh, he laughed.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I promise I will catch you if you fall,” he said, that I took it for an insult. “Drink and fuck, my friend. Drink and vomit, smoke and play cards. Curse and covet women. This is what men do.” He pours me a full glass of wine and we touched We touched glasses.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Salute</i>,” he said, but I added to the toast, as I thought it was my right.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Diu benedica la Sicilia</i>,” God bless Sicilia, as it was right and fitting, what I felt in my heart. From his cold look I see he thought little of my toast; that he was no religious man, or one given to sentiment.  He waved to the other men in his group, and Enzo was one, and they all came and joined us. We toasted until the wine was gone, then he made his way through the group, hugging, shaking hands and slapping backs, like *<i class="calibre5">Victor Emmanuel</i>, himself, or <i class="calibre5">il Papa</i>. I disliked him, right off. He drank too much, he was too big, too loud, and shook too many hands, and he loved cigars. That was the worst thing.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo whispers to, like it was some great secret; “He is from Palermu,” on the far side of Sicilia, where the great landowners lived, and they ruled with the <i class="calibre5">briganti</i> and other thieves. Landowners and <i class="calibre5">briganti,</i> my father said a thousand times, are mostly one and the same; brothers under the skin, who will steal from anyone who has no power to fight back. I have not been in <i class="calibre5">Palermu</i>, or west of <i class="calibre5">Cefalu</i>, but they say it is a beautiful place, unless you are beaten and robbed, and left for dead, or you perish in a famine, or drink diseased water, but fools say these are the things that makes life interesting. Fools say it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">A few complained on the cold night air, as they pull up collars and buttoned all the buttons, and when they left the party, they agreed with this big man to meet the next day, for a discussion of things interesting and important to all. Me? I watched the sea and counted whitecaps, then the big man taps my shoulder(I believe he was drunk by this time).   </p>
<p id="page_506" class="calibre6">“And you. How do you make your living?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Me? Uh, I work on a farm. All my life…but I am...” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sicilia has too many goddamned farmers. After all, what is a farm worker but a fool, who is a slave on another man’s land. Sicilia is filthy with you people.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He said it and meant what he said, I am certain, but he did half ass apologized, blaming the wine, and the excitement of the day. He cursed the cold night air.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I asked him, though I had little interest, “And you, signuri, what do you do for a living?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He stared off across the black sea, and seemed to ignore the question,  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I ask again.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Me? I do many things,” he said, looking straight at me, but what things I did not ask, or did I care. He cursed the wine bottle that was empty, and with a quick motion he turned and threw it across the deck, barely missing the head of an old man, who sat in the shadows, minding his business. This big ape watched the bottle fly and the man duck and laughed when the bottle busted into a thousand pieces across the deck.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did I ask him to sit there?” He offered no apology for his bad conduct, like I imagined any civilized man would do, yet he pulled at his cap, dragging it over his ears and buttoned the top button on his long coat, cursing the “goddamn cold.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, uh, you do many things for a living? Such as?” He did not like the question, answering with unclear words, meant to confuse.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I work for men who...who…well, buy and sell things.” </p>
<p id="page_507" class="calibre6">“A shopkeeper?  Maybe a clerk?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He laughs, “<i class="calibre5">Mio Dio</i>, no. No clerk. I would rather slit my throat and drink the blood.  No, my friend. We buy for a lira, and we sell for two lire. We are the second oldest profession. <i class="calibre5">Capisce</i>? Businessmen, but maybe not businessmen as you might know.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are landowners?” He shrugged.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“In a way. We own land. Sometimes. Sometimes we do not.” He glanced across the deck, waving at the old man he near killed, who shrank from his look and hurried away.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">He spit on the deck. “Good riddance. Riffraff. Nothing but riffraff.”  He went into a thinking daze, that we all do to disappear for a while. “Si, land, and sometimes, when things are right, we offer other services to businessmen and landowners.” He paused, seeming to look for the right word. “Security, si. We sell, uh, such things as security…you know…protection from <i class="calibre5">predatori. </i>These bastards will steal anything you have. We do all right.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Sometimes we do this, sometimes we do that. Sometimes we do nothing.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Stop talking shit, you fool,” I yell square in his face, and maybe I spit on him, and he pulls a rag from his pocket and wiped himself dry. He apologizes and offers to remember me in his night prayers, and because of this I felt victory for the first time in years.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Did it happen this way?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">No. I never yelled, or did I challenge him. Another daydream, pure and simple.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was late, I was tired and needed the pot, or it was over the side if no one was watching. This is the truth.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hey farmer…are you listening to me?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, yes, <i class="calibre5">mi dispiace</i>, but I need to…”  He pushes his finger in my face and I shut my mouth fast.   </p>
<p id="page_508" class="calibre6">“When you ask me a question, wait for the answer. Always. This is all I demand. Is it  something you can do?” He looked through me, I admit, and I was scarred like I have never been scarred, not even of dying the few times I imagined I was close. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, of course, signuri. I meant no disrespect.” I shook. My legs. My hands. </p>
<p class="calibre6">He relaxed and cleared his throat and gave me a long, dirty.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And sometimes we are hired by men who need,” he paused, “a piece of work done.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, you are bosses, but workers, also?” I know nothing, but I know this, in Sicilia you are the boss, or the worker. The hammer or the nail, not both, never. I wondered on this man who spoke in riddles, meant to confuse.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Two men, one carrying a wine bottle were coming toward us, staggering as if they were already drunk, and the small one, the vulgar one tossed the bottle over the side (it looked to be a full bottle of wine). I believe they were going to pass without so much as a look our way. Conte puts out his leg, and the tall one near fell to avoid it. They faced off with Conte, who was annoyed and ordered them to leave.         </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Perchè</i>? (why),” they both ask, promising to leave only when they were ready, or the wine was gone. The tall one, the drunkest of the two, said, boldly, he enjoyed the chilly night air and would stay until he chose to leave. Conte stiffened his chest and stood straight up and grabbed the tall one around the neck with two huge hands, and he <i class="calibre5">was</i> like an ape, as Enzo said, and he lifted him off the deck, feet swinging in the wind, pleading for his life, as he gasped for air, swearing to God he could not breathe. Midair he apologized for his rudeness and begged for his life, but Conte had murder in his eye. Conte laughed, the devil laugh, as he dropped the drunk, who thanked Conte for sparing him, and he grabbed his friend by the arm and both stumbled away, arguing who was at fault for crossing ‘the big sonofabitch.” Conte follows them a few feet, cursing, demanding they learn manners before coming back on deck.  </p>
<p id="page_509" class="calibre6">Enzo, who saw it all, was shaking, when he pushed me off into the shadows.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is time we left. We have no business being with this man…he is a…”  I see from the corner of my eye, Conte was acting strange, walking in circles like a dog chasing its tail, still cursing the two fools who were gone. Enzo wiped down his forehead, and I swear I heard his heart pounding from where I stood. Conti coughed hard, once, maybe twice then threw up on deck; mostly wine, but it looked like blood. He went down on one knee and coughed hard and threw up again. Not much this time. No wine, as I could see. He stood and paced, breathing heavy. He cleared his throat.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will say goodnight to you men. This fucking night air makes me tired, and sick sometimes…too much wine tonight,” and with no fanfare, no good night, or other goodbye. He stopped and turned, pointing direct at Enzo, who moved a little to get into a shadow.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You and I will speak, again,” he said. “Maybe tomorrow.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He disappeared into the black. In a few minutes the last of his cronies had wandered off, and I heard one say they should stay close to Conte, because he always has the good wine, and he knew how to return a favor. We were left alone on deck with the gulls, who made unpleasant sounds, as they perched on ropes strung between the deck poles. Gulls are by nature filthy creatures, and in my town, I am proud to say, they are shot on sight, as they have ruined the piazza, but there are more of them than grains of sand on the beach, and this battle has been going on for centuries.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">Sweat ran down Enzo’s face, but he wiped it away and cleared his throat.    </p>
<p id="page_510" class="calibre6">“This man, do not trifle with him. He is dangerous and will turn violent without provocation.” We saw the same man, talked with him, drank with him, except for his great size, his powerful look, I saw nothing special, save his poor recollection of things he should have remembered. Maybe this, maybe that. He pushed around a vulgar drunk, who deserved to be pushed around and in the end all he suffered was loss of pride. What was Contes crime?  Maybe he is on the run, maybe from a creditor, or a wife he cannot tolerate, or a tough husband, as tough as he is. Si, he drinks, but he hates drunkards, and has no problem roughing them up when they annoy him. I do not like drunks. Si. He is vague about this and that. Me? I am not good at hiding what I think. Tell no one nothing, papa says.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo was there, but quiet, like <i class="calibre5">topo</i> (a little mouse)and he refused to be part of these things, so I was surprised he had an opinion on Conte.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A well-off businessman…why do you doubt him?” he says to Enzo. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mio cuolo.</i> He claims to be a businessman, but he is a criminal. Nothing more, nothing less. I know these men. I should have smelled the stink before I took his wine.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Me? I had no opinion, or did I waste my breath arguing the good and bad of it, but Santo, who sees too much good in people. “Si, he is well dressed,” Santo admitted. “And rich. That is what we all want…no?”  Enzo was pissed that Santo respected Conte for no reason, but that he wore fine clothes, and talked like a rich man. And powerful. Santo admired his power.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “You are right, Santo. He is well-dressed. What does that mean?  He buys and sells things. What things? Honest men are not vague about what they do. He sells protection…do you know what that means?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. I do. He is a guard, or something like it. Or a Carribieneri.” </p>
<p id="page_511" class="calibre6">Enzo laughs. “A guard? A Carribieneri? No, my friend, he is anything but a Carribieneri. I know these men from <i class="calibre5">Palermu.</i> They do not work, but they rule everything, and ruin men and villages and cities, and they owned what they could touch and steal; buildings, the farms, even the boats anchored in the harbor. They took <i class="calibre5">tribute</i> (Enzo’s word) from everyman, every business, like a tax. In return they give protection from the enemy, whoever it is, whoever they say it is. But he is the enemy.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo said this of these men, he called <i class="calibre5">volgare</i> (vulgar) while Santo listened and thought, and became timid and shy, like a man asking for a favor. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But he seems all right to me.”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo throws up his arms. “Did you live under a rock in those hills?”  He backed away and stared at me, I suppose remembering that I was from the same hills as Santo. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Was I insulted by what Enzo said?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Scusa, my friends, I did not mean it that way. It is only a figure of speech, nothing more. I certainly did not mean that men from the hills are not civilized, or anything…”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Santo interrupted him. “What if you have no money?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Money?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, money. For protection. What if you have no money?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No. Please let me explain.” Enzo cleared his throat. “These men are thieves and murderers, but politicians first of all. Maybe your mayor is one of them, or the <i class="calibre5">capu</i> or even the priest.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The priest?” Santo could not believe what he heard.  “Not Patri Carmine? How is this possible?” </p>
<p id="page_512" class="calibre6">“Si, even your priest. Is there a better place to hide than in priests clothing? These men control everything.”  Santo listened and nodded that he understood. I understand because Papa talked about these men, who stole from farm workers, and beat them senseless if they refused to pay (only fools refused).  They say to their victims, “the money is nothing, do not worry. It is an investment in the future. A reasonable charge to earn a living and support your family.” <i class="calibre5">Raphaelo Centura</i> , papa’s cousin from the <i class="calibre5">Faraone</i> side, refused to pay, not a single lira. “Basta,” he said. Enough. Some say he was fighting with his wife and in a terrible bad mood, or he would not have challenged these men otherwise. He ignored their threats and cursed them in the piazza, but one night they caught him and beat him half to death in front of his family, vowing to kill him unless he paid. They leave him near dead and delirious, but still he refused to pay, so his father paid to save his son. Five lire for tribute and five lire fine. Ten lire in all. But his father was broke, <i class="calibre5">povero se stesso</i>, his whole family was starving, and where did he get the money to pay? Some say the father and another son robbed the Chiesa Di Sant’ Ana and sold what he stole to a drummer who came up the mountain selling pots and pans. This is what some say. But it was too late. The bandits took the money and beat the son again to extract revenge and make him a lesson to the comune. Raphaelo’s second beating took place early in the morning, on his way to the fields. Rather than waste the day once the beating was over, these bastards plundered the village, stealing two mules and a good size wagon;  loaded it with chairs and tables until the booty was falling off the sides. A lira here, a lira there, most men paid, including papa, while fools (a few) fled to the mountains.  Raphaelo’s cousin, *<i class="calibre5">Natale Giarusso</i>, went to the Carabinieri, down the mountain, in <i class="calibre5">Ali’ Marina</i>.  These bandits come back, blaming <i class="calibre5">Raphaelo</i> for what his cousin did (inform) and they beat on him again, this time leaving his dead body on <i class="calibre5">Via Roma; </i>tongue cut out, and stuffed back into his mouth. His three sons, boasting like men, swore revenge on the rabble who murdered their father. When they grew up and were men, they still talked revenge at Sunday diner and every festival. How did they revenge their father’s death? Nothing. They did shit. <i class="calibre5">Niente</i>.   </p>
<p id="page_513" class="calibre6">*<i class="calibre5">Silvio Conte</i> is one of these people, Enzo says, and he knows it to be true, the evidence is no more than bad answers and fine clothes, unless he knows more and will not say.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“He is big, <i class="calibre5">brute</i>, like a bear, says Enzo, and this is part of his proof. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Me? What did I know, except what others tell me?    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo shivered as he continued to complain. “I am not dressed for this weather,” he said, and pulled the lapels of his coat tight, and it seemed to do no good. I sensed it was more than bad weather that caused his shivering. He was afraid of Conte, I figured, but it was a big ship, and we would not see him again. He was certainly not steerage. We walked to the door (hatch they say at sea) that went to steerage, or third class, however it is called. I would gladly sleep on deck, save for the freezing weather, and like Conte and Enzo, I hated the cold and could not tolerate it, and hell fire did not seem so bad to me. I joke, of course.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Antonino</i>...<i class="calibre5">aspetta</i>.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I stopped when I heard the voice, and wondered, was it a mix of the wind and my imagination, or was I wanted. I figured the boat was full of Antonino’s.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What is your hurry…sleep when you are dead.” It was Conte, walking back from the shadows into the light. I was shocked to see him again, and it went through my mind that he waited for me. No one else. For me.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Stay, <i class="calibre5">paesano</i>. Talk with me awhile.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Me? You want me?”  </p>
<p id="page_514" class="calibre6">The moon was straight up and bright, and on it I see the figure of a man, and the light he sent to earth was blue, and blue light changes the look of things. Conte looked older than before, maybe forty, forty-five, black hair that was thick, covering his eyes and he was not as well-groomed as I thought. His face was rough, holding deep lines, like a rutted road, and he looked more brutish than before. And pits. His face was deep pitted, like the Roman roads in Sicilia, but women would like him and enjoy him, but the blue night did him no favors. Enzo called him  “<i class="calibre5">scimmia</i>,” an ape, and I thought it a harsh thing to say, until I see Conte in this light. But it is a disrespectful thing to say any man is an ape.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Have a cigar with me,” he said, more a demand and I understood it as a demand. I shuffled my feet and scratched at my arm, and I stuttered too much.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will stay for a minute, just a minute, if you want, but my friends are leaving.” Enzo and Santo said “<i class="calibre5">buona notte</i>,” together, and backed into the shadows. I admit I was afraid to say no, as I saw him as a rugged man; a man’s man, who would not take “no” from other men.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">What did he need from me?  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I brushed the dirt and dust from my jacket, to seem calm and relaxed. “I will stay a while, but I am dead tired…we have walked too many miles and slept on the ground, and maybe…”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He put his giant hand in front of my face. “<i class="calibre5">Basta</i>,” he said. “You talk too much,” but he said it almost politely, as he relaxed against the railing, a cigar rolled tight, in each hand. “Smoke one with me.” I shook my head. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mi dispiace</i>, I am sorry.” I said this carefully, only to show my respect. “But I do not smoke.” He was quiet, then he laughed hard and began to cough. “A Siclianu dirt farmer who does not smoke? This I cannot believe.” He leaned in, a foot from my face. I smelled the wine. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you fuck women or play cards?” He laughed.  </p>
<p id="page_515" class="calibre6">“Bad lungs, <i class="calibre5">signuri Conte.</i>” I said it meekly, almost ashamed it was not a lie. As to the other questions, about women and cards, I did not answer. If he was just anyone, I would fight him.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You see, signuri, I was cursed with bad lungs, from birth and I have suffered all my life.  Smoke, even slightest smell, makes me sick. It is not personal.” There was an angry stare from his eyes, as if I had insulted his sainted mother. He cocked his head slightly forward, staring down at me, as he was four or five inches taller and much wider. Si, an ape, like Enzo said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“It is not personal? Is that what you said?” He became a mad bull, with fire in his green eyes, ready to charge me. Say something to calm this crazy man or run away.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, signuri, I just...”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He stood up straight, his chest thrown back, arms at the side of his body, with clenched fists. His face turned red and at that moment I feared for my life.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Personal? What is this ‘personal?’ I want to share a smoke…not fuck you.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">The curses flowed easy from his mouth, and for his own purpose he kicked the railing and threw both cigars over the side. My jaw was loose, it moved easy, and my tongue was ready,  but no words came out. I was frozen where I stood. I grab the air behind my back, feeling for anything that would block my retreat. Run like a jackrabbit. But in the middle of a curse, no special curse, they were all the same, he calmed down and turned away from me and laughed.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“All dirt farmers think they are tough men, but I will teach you a lesson.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He grabbed me with gigantic and grotesque hands and pulled me at him. His grip was like the jaws of a vice, and I could not break it and his arms were machines. Beg him for your life, that is what I thought to do. Admit it to him, you are a weepy coward, not worth his trouble. But he tired of me and let go, then patted my face and squeezed my cheek, like my grandmother did many times. I was sweating like a pig in July. He smiled.     </p>
<p id="page_516" class="calibre6">“Life is tough when you cannot take a joke. Can you take a joke, Antonino?”     </p>
<p class="calibre6">I stepped back, a few steps, not enough that he would see it as an insult; I wiped the sweat from my forehead with my jacket sleeve. A handkerchief would have been to <i class="calibre5">femminile</i> and there would be bad jokes and I would be the object of these jokes.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course, I know, you were joking, but your grip is as strong as I have seen on any man, and it is common sense that a man with your power gets what he wants.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">My God, how far will I go to make a fool of myself. Must I kiss his naked ass, here on the deck? I would do it if he said to do it, and smile.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Basta</i>,” he said, again. “You talk too much for a man who is not a boss.” He brushed at the sleeves of his jacket and straightened his collar, and now he looked like an important man, not a thug, as Enzo believed.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Spend time with me while we are on the boat,” he said, his arm around my shoulder. “I would like to know you and your friends. Especially this Luca.” Luca? What is his interest with Luca? How did he know Luca existed? I thought to brush him aside, that we would be busy making plans, and if, by some chance, we met on the deck, so be it. In my head I see his hand slapping me down, and his knife stuck in my eye, and he is turning it and laughing. My God, am I finally pazzo?     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tonight, we can talk. Here and now.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, si, of course I will stay a while,” and like old friends, we leaned together on the railing, starring into the black sea, as it slapped against the iron hull. Say something, Antonino. </p>
<p id="page_517" class="calibre6">“Black as the inside of a boot,” is what my grandfather said of these nights. He said nothing to this, but after a time he spoke, making small talk about Sicilia, vague talk, making no sense. Maybe ‘this’ or maybe ‘that,’ or maybe ‘nothing.’ He was not from <i class="calibre5">Palermu</i> (unless he lied) as Enzo said, but a hill village, miles from the sea. The name of his town? When I asked, he looked away.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You have never heard of it,” he said, then spit on the deck.   </p>
<p class="calibre6"> His mother was dead, the last he heard, and he hoped she stayed dead. He laughed, maybe thinking it was funny thing to say, but I have never heard a man joke about his dead mother. He hated her, because she abandoned her family when he was a child, and his hope was simple, that she was rotting in hell, though he did not believe there is a hell. As to her,  anger came from every pore in his body, like sweat, and I expected he would murder me just because I was there. He is married in the eyes of the Church, and there are children, two or three, “how you choose to see it.” His wife and the two or three children lived with her mother near <i class="calibre5">Palermu</i>, or <i class="calibre5">Marsalla</i>, or <i class="calibre5">Patti</i>, but he had no desire to see any of them again.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Fuck them all,” he said, “including her children.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He searched through his pockets and pulled out a short cigar; a single Sicilian stogie, black, all twisted, but he admired its look, as he held it to the moonlight. He lit it and blew the smoke in my direction; I coughed some, and he seemed surprised, but otherwise I suffered quietly, as complaining would make him angry. He talked about nothing that interested me, so I passed the time counting things, including thirty-seven deck panels across the width of the ship, and nineteen wooden barrels tied to the far railing, twenty-one poles and six flags, not Italiano or Siclianu, but German (Tedesco). The wind shifted from the south, and now I heard the bleating of goats, making me think of milk and cheese. He took my arm and squeezed and smiled.  </p>
<p id="page_518" class="calibre6">“No more bullshit,” he said, spitting again. “Tell me about this Luca, the strong one you travel with.” He pointed to a gull perched on the railing, “Notice how they sit facing the sea and watching it. Always. Eat and shit…that’s all they do.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca? I wonder, how does this cavone know Luca’s name; I ask. expecting he would tell me <i class="calibre5">vaffancuolo</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A little bird told me he is no man to fool with. Is it true?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Luca? You mean *<i class="calibre5">Luca Ponto</i>?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Ponto</i>? Is that his name? Who is the old man? He says this Luca is…how did he say it…forceful and can make a point.” I thought about what he said. </p>
<p class="calibre6"> “Forceful? Si, he makes his point when necessary.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Bene. </i>This is what I want to hear.” He pushed his thumb into his chest. “I am going into business for myself. I need men. Good men to help me with things, well, things I have to do. If this Luca is to my liking,” he paused, grunting to clear his throat,“Maybe I will hire him if he is lucky and then he will be with me.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, <i class="calibre5">Luca</i>…<i class="calibre5">Luca Ponto</i>. But hire him for what?” He scowled at me pretty good. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“For what? That is my business. Now tell me something about him. But only what I want to hear.” He laughed.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What is your business, signuri?” I asked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He stared into my eyes. “Business. My business. That is all you have to know.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The wind shifted west. I hear God say, “Luca is <i class="calibre5">your</i> friend, Antonino. Save him.” I look back on that day and now I believe I imagined the words were from God (I was cold and tired). When I am backed into a corner, and I have no good and honorable way out, I will change the subject to one I appreciate, or have some interest in.   </p>
<p id="page_519" class="calibre6">“The priest? The <i class="calibre5">Scalabrinan</i>?  Did you hear him singing? It was beautiful. Men and women wept. Did you hear him?” Conte folded his arms and sighed hard as you would to a bad child.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Priest? What priest?  I saw no priest, and I heard no music. Music on this garbage scow? You imagined it all. You are scared, shitting your pants, because you have left home. Like old women and nothing else. God was singing through him. Is that what you think?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He laughed. How sorry he was for fools like me.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, signuri, I saw him. A tall man, in a black robe, standing in the middle of this very deck, singing the ‘<i class="calibre5">Ave Maria</i>.’ Never have I heard such beautiful music. Not even in church…I still hear it, as if the beautiful sounds were trapped in the wind.” Conte laughed and turned his ear to the wind and listened. His green, Sicilian eyes grew twice their size, and he used them, like weapons, to intimidate me.        </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I hear nothing, and there was no goddamned priest. You drank too much wine, my friend. And you are scared, but I have no interest in you.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The priest, he was standing…”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Never mind the goddamned priest. I am talking business, here and now.”  He tugged on his right ear.  “<i class="calibre5">Ascoliti</i>,” he shouted, but I am only two feet away. “Listen to what I say.” He taps his foot on the deck. “Are you listening, pisano?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, of course, signuri, I just …” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“My uncle has called me to America. ‘Bring good men,’ he said. But the men I asked betrayed me,” and his fists clenched. “This one was afraid to leave Sicilia, that one was busy.” He points across the almost empty deck, at no one, at nothing. “That one was sick, his ass ached, or something foolish and cowardly. Any excuse. They are not reliable men. I swear to repay their favor one day.” He leaned in, close to me, and I feel his breath on my face.   </p>
<p id="page_520" class="calibre6">“Paisano. I want the truth. This Luca? Is he a reliable man?” He grabbed the back of my neck, and  smiled, and I see a tooth was broken off. Half gone.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Capisce</i>, pisano? <i class="calibre5">La verità</i>. ”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo is right: Ponto a brigand, a criminal, and thank God Luca is his prey, not me. I decided I would lie, say that Luca is a sonofabitch, lazy and good for nothing, who cannot be trusted to shit and wipe his ass. Then I think: What if Luca wants this life? Am I his keeper? By what right do I lie for him, when he has not asked me to lie? He will face the consequences alone, but not with me by his side, this I have decided. There are men who admire <i class="calibre5">brigands</i>, even the murders they do, as they are powerful and wealthy, and do anything they please. I know this fascinates many men, Me? I hate these bastards, more because my father and his father hated these bastards. But Luca respects powerful things. Every Sicilian who is born like me, poor, will die poor, and we each live with a mark on our skulls where they press the barrel, and the mark is passed from father to son. I despise men like Conte, but they do, they survive, and they prosper.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This Luca? He is a farmer? <i class="calibre5">Ē vero</i>?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. We are all farmers, yes, but Enzo, is some kind of a teacher. We met him in Napoli a just few hours ago.” Conte threw back and laughed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And the skinny one, the runt, who acts like a woman. A good fart would blow him over the side.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“That is Santo,” I said. “A friend and a good worker.”  Conte thought.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Has he been in the Army?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Santo?” </p>
<p id="page_521" class="calibre6">“No, Luca…to hell with this Santo. Forget him. I am only interested in Luca.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, yes, he has been in the army. And I have. Have you, signuri?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Conte smiled, pounding his chest, like an ape. <i class="calibre5">La scimmia.</i> Enzo was right.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Good for you, but the Army was not for me, or men like me. Slaves serve without choice.” He leaned forward. “Do I look like a slave?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, <i class="calibre5">signuri</i>, you do not. But we were drafted, forced to serve. They came for us with guns, like we were the enemy. They took me, kicking and screaming and I was theirs for two years. I get along, but Luca always hated other men’s rules. He lasted five, maybe six months, until a crazy bastard bombed the piazza he was guarding, near killing him. His arm, his leg, near mangled by the blast. Look at his eye when he is tired and see it droop and his face. He spent months in the hospital, until they set him loose and told him to go home. But he has said it many </p>
<p class="calibre13">times, it was worth it to get out.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Conte was pleased, that Luca hated rules, that he was a survivor, like a warrior. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Bene, bene</i>,” he said, inching closer along the rail, until he was at my shoulder. “He is a good piece of property. I have use for a man like him. A fighter. You say fearless?” He rubbed his hands together, briskly and smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre6">I scratched my face, a bad habit when I pause to think. “I have never seen him back down, <i class="calibre5">signuri</i>. Si. He is fearless, if that is what you want, fearless, like some wounded animals, or a man with nothing to lose. I have seen him fight two men at once, over a glass of bad grappa. He beat them both, bad, then threw the grappa on the ground. He plain enjoys the fight.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Conte slapped my shoulder, then rubbed his huge hands together, like he was starting a fire with two sticks.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Bene, bene. </i>He is the kind of man I need.” He stared across the deck.  </p>
<p id="page_522" class="calibre6">“How did you escape the army?” He turned fast and stared at me, with his ape eyes.  “I mean you look fit. Luca was fit, but not Santo. They say his heart is bad. Not that there is any shame in it. If you beat them, more power to you, I say. Me? My lungs are bad I tell the army doctor. He listened. ‘Good enough to fight,’ he said. ‘If you can breathe, you can carry a rifle.’ The bastard...the sonofabitch that he was.” Conte grabbed my coat and pulls me toward him, and we were near face to face. “Do you insult me, you little sonofabitch? Am I a coward?” He stood straight and rigid. “Am I a coward?” he repeats the question. I did not answer, and he calmed down, thank God.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But you are right, I escaped the goddamned army, and they were better off for it. I would have killed those bastards, one by one. I take orders from no one.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Was it the doctor? He failed you because of a bad heart. You were too weak to fight?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He pushed me against the rail. “Weak? Is that what you said. Ask any woman in <i class="calibre5">Palermu</i>,” and he laughed, and pulled two cigars from his pocket, handing me one of the smokes. I coughed and refused it. “No, grazie, my lungs. They are good for breathing, but the smoke…”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ah, <i class="calibre5">si</i>, your lungs,” he said, and I figured with his tone, he did not believe a word of it. I was tired and cold and I admit fearing this cavone, who <i class="calibre5">was</i> a criminal, as Enzo said. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You ask why I was not in the army, like you and this war hero…What’s his name?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Ponto. Luca Ponto</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Ponto</i>, si. Well, my friend, it was a misunderstanding, as you think. I will tell you the story, but not the whole story, because you have no need to hear the whole story, but enough of the story, and you will understand how we are treated in this country.” He took deep drags on his cigar, blowing smoke into the wind and it disappeared and for no good reason, as I could see, he threw his good cigar over the side. He lifted his collar against the wind.     </p>
<p id="page_523" class="calibre6">“There was a woman in my village, older than me and beautiful, of course, but demanding, like all <i class="calibre5">Siciliana </i>women who are bitches and need a backhand twice or three times a day. You know the kind of women I mean.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course, signuri. I have heard of women who cannot be pleased, are always moody and never satisfied with the way things are; who knows what they are thinking, and they forget their place. Si, signuri, I have heard of women like this.”       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then you understand what I have to say’ </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si. No doubt I will understand.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Good. Then listen closely. One night, in Agosto, on the seventh day, years ago. The air boiled, so nothing moved, not the people, not even the wind. Nothing. No one could sleep. I drank too much wine that day…two, maybe three full bottles…and I wanted to, well, I wanted too…” He stopped his story and stared at me. “You understand what I am saying?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I said I did, but I was embarrassed that he asked, like you would ask some child. We do not talk about these things in the hills.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He patted his pockets for another cigar.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We fought,” he said, “loud and violent, like a war. People who were not in the street came out to look and gaped at our window, like goddamned fools. She had enough, she kept saying, sometimes screaming it. She was going back to her family, but I did not want it that way.” From the top pocket on his fine jacket, he brought out a rough, white cloth, not a handkerchief, more a rag, and wiped the back of his neck. I was freezing, my teeth ached from the chatter of my jaw, but he sweated like a pig in the sun. He turned his head from me, and when he spoke again, I could barely hear him over the roar of wind in my ears.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Scusa,” I said, with humility, not to provoke him. “What did you say?”   </p>
<p id="page_524" class="calibre6">He looked at me, with rage eyes and screamed, an inch from my face, “They said I killed her, but it was a lie.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You what?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They said I killed her. Are you deaf?” Now hearing him clearly, I backed off, ready to run from this crazy bastard.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I wanted her to stay with me, that’s all. I asked why she hated me, but she refused to give me her answer.” The rage was gone; he seemed calm, and his head hung, limp. I believe he was crying, but who was I to look closer, or ask?  He coughed and wiped his mouth clean and threw the rag into the sea, and watched it float until it disappeared. He rubbed his hands and wrists, groaning like a man in terrible pain.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Twenty years…I still feel the manacles,” he said. “They pushed me around…treated me like shit...an animal. When I was freed, I was full-grown, and they ordered me to leave the country.” He leaned to me. “My country. Who the fuck are they to order me out of my own country? Have you heard of such a thing?” He searched for another cigar, but had none, and he cursed his poor luck. He asked, did I smoke, could he have a cigar if I did? He needed a smoke bad, and he fidgeted with his hands. I was afraid to say no, so I mumble, and he nodded and the howl of the wind saved me.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You did not leave when they ordered you out.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Leave? Leave what? </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sicilia. You were told to leave.” He laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“When in hell, I made friends with men who had friends, and everything went away.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He pushed his right hand close to my face, rubbing his fingertips together, hard. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">I soldi parlano</i>,” he said, laughing, words every Siclianu understands.  </p>
<p id="page_525" class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">I soldi parlano</i>. Money talks. What did it mean for Conte? </p>
<p class="calibre6">His story was too crazy to be a lie. She refused to answer him, <i class="calibre5">Mio Diu</i>, then she was dead. Did he murder her? He did not say, but his emotions were real and strong, and honest as I could see, and what man can fake these things. If he murdered her, he deserved to rot in jail, praying for his own death. In Sicilia, they “throw away the key,” but papa says there is no key, and no locked door that cannot be opened. Why is he here, with me, on his way to America? Maybe he escaped. But the book. They always check the book, so I was confused. We did not speak for a long time, and the longer the silence the harder it would be for me to leave with some dignity. Thank God, a ragged looking sailor come by, dragging a long pole to put out the deck lights. As he snuffed each lamp, the deck became darker, and I saw an honorable way to escape this madman. I would wait for clouds to cover the moon, and when the last light was out, the deck would be as dark as the sea, and then I would slip away. </p>
<p class="calibre6">Cowardly? <i class="calibre5">Certo</i>. So what? Who is not cowardly, at the right time and place?   </p>
<p class="calibre6">He broke the silence. “I hate this goddamned cold,” he said, as he pulled the collar of his fine jacket higher on his neck. He was a man to be envied, in that way, the fine clothes.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tomorrow, maybe, I will see this Luca, the great man you say he is, and if he is right, I will make him a good offer he will not refuse.” He said, again, how much he hated the cold. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Everything is good,” he said, offering his hand. “Now I will say <i class="calibre5">buonasera</i> to you.” He waited for me to take his hand, and I was afraid not to take it. I asked on his cabin, where it was in the ship, as I intended to walk the other way.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Close to here.” He stared at me. “Why do you ask?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Uh, no reason. “You are…uh…First Class?  Is that what they call it? First Class?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“They? Who are ‘they’ you speak of?” </p>
<p id="page_526" class="calibre6">I stuttered, and he laughed and I see he laughed a lot for an angry man.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si</i>. First Class,” he said. “<i class="calibre5">Il migliore</i>. The best…and where are you?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, we are in…” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Let me ask you? This Luca?  I have heard he brings protection. Is it true?”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Protection?  <i class="calibre5">Non capisco, signuri</i>.”  He moved in closer to me and using his finger, like the barrel of a gun, he touched my nose. “Bang. You are dead.” I flinched and stepped back. He laughs, like a crazy man and I ask myself, ‘how much fear can one man feel, and not drop dead in his tracks?” I turn away and feel at my crouch and it is still dry, <i class="calibre5">grazie a Dio.   </i></p>
<p class="calibre6">“No matter,” he said, waving me away, “tell this Luca we will talk. Maybe tomorrow. Tell him about me. Make certain he knows I am a serious man.” He backed into the shadows and disappeared.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">I walk double time to the iron door, that was open and swinging as the boat was thrown about by bad waves. The stairway was dark and greasy, lit with a single oil lamp, near empty of fuel. I stumbled a few steps, but grabbed the handrail before falling all the way, but my knee hit the edge of the metal step. I give out a yell to wake the dead, but in my head, I see Conte coming down the stairs, laughing, stopping to lend me a hand up, saying I owed him a favor and he would collect soon enough. I lay there a few minutes, suffering silently, like a man must do. I reach for the rail and pull myself up, nervous that someone would come by and ask if I needed help. Hobbling down the stairs was torture. The corridor at the bottom was dark, as the two lamps were out of fuel. I cursed the lazy bastard who did not do his job, but I feel along the wall, thinking about <i class="calibre5">Signuri *Pascarella</i>, the blind man, who walked the streets back home, feeling at the buildings to get along. If I see him on the street again, this time I will not ignore him as I always did. They say he lost his eyes fighting for Garibaldi, when a musket exploded in his face; is it true? I know ten men, ten times ten men who have ten relatives who say they fought with  <i class="calibre5">Garibaldi</i>. <i class="calibre5">Pascarella</i> is blind, for a fact, but the cause I take with a grain of salt, as it does not matter to me. Who is not a hero in his own mind?  </p>
<p id="page_527" class="calibre6">After a wrong turn, right, not left, I realized my mistake and went back, feeling the wall for some sign I was near the end. What if I cannot find my way home? Home?  <i class="calibre5">Mio Diu.</i> I called it home. A sailor, some kind of security man, I believe, holding a small lantern lead me through this confusion to the right door. We talked. He was from <i class="calibre5">Francavilla, Sicilia</i>, that made us <i class="calibre5">pisani </i>of a kind. His ninth trip to America and back, he said, with few complaints, except the food was bad and the water is dirty, but his life was better at sea. He hated the German officers, but admitted Italian officers were not much better, except one from Milano and one from Roma (who hated the Germans).  He started to leave, and I grabbed his arm.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Grazie for or saving me from a night of walking in circles.”   </p>
<p class="calibre7">“My pleasure. We are almost brothers.” I never asked his name, or did I see him again. </p>
<p class="calibre7">**** </p>
<p class="calibre6">The cabin door was braced open by a short length of twisted iron, painted a dark and dirty green, like the inside of the ship. It was well past midnight and most everyone was sleeping, but a few, the restless ones, lay on their blankets, staring at the ceiling, or around the cabin, hoping to see something they should not see. I stepped over suitcases and bags that were left in the  narrow walkway. Light from a small oil lamp over the door, flickered, casting an unnatural shadow on the longest wall and the deep, growling sound of snores and grunts echoed off the iron hull and the wooden walls and ceiling. A man, about five rows from the toilette was talking nonsense to no one in particular. How do I sleep with these noises; the snoring and grunts, and the iron wall that squeals as it speaks a language of its own? My mother, God love her, makes a juice from a root with no name, that she picks from the side of <i class="calibre5">Monte Elena</i> . “It will help you sleep,” she said, but in the confusion of the last day, I left the bottle home, on the table my grandfather made when I was a boy.     </p>
<p id="page_528" class="calibre6">The cabin was always cold, and the only warmth for the body was to wrap it in a woolen blanket, or more than one blanket if by chance one was left unclaimed in the corner. If your blanket was stolen, or lost, or pissed on, there are no more to be had, anyway; this is what the sailor said. It was made from cheap wool, and harsh, like an army blanket, little better than no blanket at all. I brought nothing better, so why bitch. If I were a woman, no double I would be interested in brining soft blankets, especially if I had children, or a man. Tonight, I sleep in my clothes, and probably every night I will sleep in my clothes, for another of my fears is nakedness. I have been naked in front of men before, in the army, but it never seemed civilized to me, and there are women and children here, who have no need to see me as God made me, as bad as it is. Today is the third, no, the fourth day in these clothes. The smell of me, like a garbage heap in <i class="calibre5">Augusto, </i>without the flies, or other bugs and vermin, was finally making me sick. Tomorrow, I change, if there is a place to stand naked and keep my dignity, and there is no line or wait. I should be used to filth by now., but I am not, no matter that this trip is just a few weeks. In *<i class="calibre5">Vito Fiumara’s</i> orchard, after a straight week of work, no days’ rest, I stunk, even lye soap would not do the job after the first day. The clothes stuck to my back, so I soaked in the stream before I could peel them away. Who do I fool? I have never lived the high life. I work in shit. I sleep in shit. I am a dirty man, not by nature, or birth, but to survive. Now I am filthy to the bone, from the walk and the night on the ground; my skin felt like a thousand fleas were crawling over me. After a thankful prayer to Santa Agatha, that she has kept us safe, I wanted sleep, clean water and maybe a sliver of good bread. Mama’s good bread.  A man, I could tell, even with the poor light, had taken a place in the next bunk and snored and snorted through the night, like a black bull. My knee throbbed like a smashed thumb, or the bad tooth (the worst pain, my father said, though women say childbirth, and he said I should never disagree). During the night the goddamned ceiling started to move in on me, closer and closer, pressing at my whole body, and for a time I struggled to breathe, at the same time thinking, maybe, it was over for me. But now I am a wiser man, and now I know what is real and what I imagine(most of the time). Anyway, I was soaking in my own sweat from the heat, and the pounding metal sounds of the engines, like giant iron feet hitting the ground, bang, bang, bang, made me near crazy. I was awake most of the night, worrying as I usually do, this time wondering if Luca would take work with this cavone, <i class="calibre5">Conte</i>, but it <i class="calibre5">was</i> between the two men and this I understood. I tapped a rhythm on the floor, to match the rhythm of the engine and then it was morning, or it seemed like morning. The sun, if it was out over this God forsaken sea, was hidden by an iron hull and two decks, but we were under water, and it was lucky for us we made it through the night. I was grateful to be alive, but I wanted to say no more prayers, because I prayed enough and later, I prayed and gave thanks to someone. In all, through the night, I slept a few hours, maybe not.  </p>
<p id="page_529" class="calibre6">Out of nowhere, Enzo sat up, all rigid, and stared into a wood wall. I called his name, he smiled and looked away. This morning was the first morning, ever, I did not see the sun, or light from the sun(I do not count the light from the lamps, as it is orange and stutters and flickers; not natural light, therefore not real light).     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Enzo…wake up…what time is it?” He turned to me, and his neck cracked, and it sounded like a limb breaking off a tree, a frightening sound that always gave me chills.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What time is it?” I asked again.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Groggy from sleep, he slowly rubbed his eyes, and reached under the pillow for his pocket watch.  “Ah, uh,” he groaned, “it’s a…five in the morning. What is wrong?”  He stood and tripped on his own blanket and cursed, complaining on the infirmities of old age, that he was cold and had no natural light. He was clear, hated it all. Why is he here?      </p>
<p id="page_530" class="calibre6">“This is not to my liking,” he said, smoothing his night clothing (a long shirt he carried in his poke, and I was embarrassed for him). It showed all of him, from slightly below the waist to the floor. I turned away. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have not been in a dormitory for thirty years,” he said. “Maybe forty.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I understand what you say. I slept three in a room my whole life, in nothing but a…a stable, and the walls were pieces of cloth hanging from rope. But this? Sleeping with strangers? Like the goddamned army. No, it is worse than the army.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">I look across the room. “The women,” I said. He agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Women are a great distraction.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">I wondered, did he speak from experience?  I have little experience in this life, and no experience with strange women, and none with Carmela to speak of, thank God. I have never slept in a room with a woman, but my mother and sisters and not since I was a child. A woman coughed (I could tell from the fineness of the cough). I covered myself, and near died from the embarrassment, although I am certain she was not looking at me and she saw nothing. Enzo glanced to the end of the cabin.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The toilet. I must take a shit. Excuse my gutter language.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Si, the morning shit, at the same time for every peasant in Italia, but only once a day, like law. This was his confession.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Five in the morning is a great distraction to me.”  </p>
<p id="page_531" class="calibre6">His talk got me stirring, and there came this fierce, uncontrollable rumbling in my gut. Some pain, but bearable. Gas pain. This was our first time for the toilet.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“An adventure inside of an adventure,” Enzo said, whatever it meant.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Men Here” and “Women Here,” were signs nailed to the doors. I said he should go first, ahead of me, as he was older and wiser and deserved first crack at the pot. He was a cautious man, and educated, and knocked twice or three times, pushed easy on the door, and it opened without much effort. The room was a six, seven-foot square, near dark, except for slivers of light coming from wide openings in the ceiling; dim, but more than enough to conduct our business. The toilette stunk pretty bad, raw is what Enzo said, but not a regular stink, more a choking stink, and you held your breath, or it could not be tolerated, no matter how fast you came in and went out. I did, for as long as I could, until I was lightheaded, nearly passing out.              </p>
<p class="calibre6">Right off I see Enzo erred on his description of the pots. There was <i class="calibre5">no</i> pot or pail, but a wooden box, a plain looking commode made for six (maybe the pots were inside, but I refused to look, before or after).  In the corner, a small water barrel filled to the top and when the boat rocked, the water spilt onto the floor, mixing with oily sawdust, making for a mess. I cupped my hands and dipped into the barrel, but Enzo grabbed my shoulder and pointed to a sign. “Not for drinking, Antonino. <i class="calibre5">Non potabile.</i> For cleaning, no more.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">How should I know this?  “Good enough for grapes?” I asked.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">No, in Enzo’s opinion, though he was not an expert. Find good drinking water, he said. <i class="calibre5">Potabile.</i></p>
<p class="calibre6">As to our place on the commode, “Pick your seat,” he said, with a pleasant smile. “One to six, your choice, and we will pray together.” I pick the hole at the far end, as I could lean against the wall if I grew tired or bored. The box was poorly made, not suited as a commode, except the holes that were properly spaced and not perfectly round. These boxes should be sturdy, with some decoration and sanded smooth (that was the issue).  Enzo rubbed his hand across the wood. </p>
<p id="page_532" class="calibre6">“There are no commode standards these days,” he said. I believe he joked.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">There were no rags to be had, or cloth, or papers, so the last of the job was left for another time, I am ashamed to say. A man and a boy, his son, I guessed, came in and we nodded to be friendly, but did not speak. The boy was scared, shaking, and this I understood. Fear has no age limit.       </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will write a book on this,” Enzo said.  “I have written many.”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“A book…what about?”  He looked surprised that I asked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well,” he said, scratching at a sore on the side of his head, “immigrants, of course.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Immigrants?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo points to the four corners of the cabin.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Us,” he said, in a quiet voice. “You and me, all of us. A few hours ago, we were emigrant’s (his word) and now we are immigrants. Maybe tomorrow, or the next day, or next year, we will be Americans. You and me, Santo, crazy Luca. Americans. <i class="calibre5">This</i> is what I will write about, where we are from, where we have been and where we are going. To a new and better life, I believe.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Who am I?  A man. My father’s son. A farmer, a soldier (not my choice) and now an immigrant; soon, maybe an American, if they let me in the door. Is it possible to be all these things in one life, and still be ‘<i class="calibre5">contadini,’ </i>who are poor people and luckless?  Is this the best I will ever be? I hold my life in high esteem, except the soldier life, that was not my choice or my liking. Immigrant? I have not heard the word before, but there was a fine feeling to it. By now, the sonofabitch next to me was gone; he slipped away when my back was turned, quiet, like a thief. I would have fought him, but I did not have the desire to fight (hoping Luca would fight for me if needed).  I peeled through his blankets and found an empty wine bottle, fresh, and I knew whoever he is, he was drunk and flopped on the first blanket he found, meaning no personal insult to me. I sat and thought, and said this to Enzo, that I worried on what came next. He answered wisely, “the rest is coming next.” Did I travel with a great thinker, or an angel sent to watch over me, like the angel on the ceiling of the <i class="calibre5">Chiesa di Sant’ Agatha. </i>My neck hairs shivered, but I settled it in my mind that he was no angel. I found the guts to ask what I would not have asked before, when I thought he might have been an angel, sent by God, or some other spiritual and religious being.  </p>
<p id="page_533" class="calibre6">“Enzo?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si</i>, <i class="calibre5">Antonino</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">I shuffled my feet like a child afraid to ask for another piece of bread.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Will you, uh…”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Will I what, <i class="calibre5">Antonino</i>?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Never mind. It is a foolish thing.” He smiled.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am captive, Antonino. Ask me now, or do not ask me again.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I will ask, but if I ask you will not laugh at me. <i class="calibre5">Ē vero</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo nodded and smiled, and I took it that he would not laugh, being an educated man. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Teach me to read,” I said, like a humble man.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">He was taken back, I see, that maybe, I had the balls to ask, as he was a superior man and a stranger to me. I thought about the good things he could teach; the bad things I knew.  </p>
<p id="page_534" class="calibre6">“You cannot read?” he said, shaking his head. Did he think I lied? Who would lie and claim to be ignorant, when he was not? The <i class="calibre5">compatire</i>, the pity I see on his god damned face. I hated it.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Just a few words of reading, a little writing, to help me in America.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course. I will do my best,” he said, patting my arm.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We will study each night, enough that you can learn on your own.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Why would Enzo do this? He is nothing to me, or me to him. Not even distant cousins, except we sleep in the same cabin by a flip of the coin, and we have shared a commode, but I have done this with a hundred men in the fields and not felt close to any of them or trusted one more than another. We have been thrown together, like things in a storm, by a great wind, or he was sent to me for a reason. An angel? I liked the feel of it, the sound of the words and I felt better and safer than any time since we started this trip. I took to my blanket and fell off; when I woke it was an hour, or maybe hours later, but who could tell with no good look at the sun, hidden by three decks and an iron hull. Santo and Luca were making small talk (what was there to say?) but small talk was great talk for the next two weeks. I have said this before.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">Where do we piss?” Luca asked. Enzo points at the end of the cabin.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The toilette,” he said, but we came to call it the “wash place,” as this is what the women called it.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I feel <i class="calibre5">animale</i>,” Luca said, “like these people are watching two cows fuck and I am one of the cows.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Si, </i>sometimes you are,” I said, but he ignored me and went off to do his business, but I followed as all this talk of toilets stirred me.  A man and a boy were staring at both doors, maybe wondering what door to take.    </p>
<p id="page_535" class="calibre6">“Go ahead of us,” he said, pointing to the young boy. “He is a fine boy and my nephew.” He turned from the boy and whispered, “He is shy since his father…my brother…was killed in a mudslide. I am bringing him to America. His mother has three more. She cannot care for all of them.” He introduced himself.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I am *<i class="calibre5">Giovanni Marino</i>, from <i class="calibre5">Nizza</i>, in <i class="calibre5">Sicilia</i>, living in America for most of ten years. I will soon be an American citizen.”  Lucas eyes opened wide.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are from <i class="calibre5">Nizza? W</i>e are from Ali Superiore. We are almost neighbors.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">Giovanni and Luca hugged.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Mio Diu</i>, my brother’s wife, this boy’s mother, was born in <i class="calibre5">Ali</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Her name?” I asked.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“*<i class="calibre5">Maria Anzalone</i>. Do you know her?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">We did not remember a <i class="calibre5">Maria</i>, but the last name, <i class="calibre5">Anzalone</i>, was familiar.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“The family moved to <i class="calibre5">Nizza</i> years ago,” he said. “To find work. They lived good until my brother died, God rest his soul,” and he makes the sign of the cross. “His widow found work in the ceramic factory, twelve hours a day, making cups, for the god damned English. <i class="calibre5">Bastardi</i>.  So many cups, to this day she will not drink from ceramic, only glass.”    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“God rest his soul, your brother,” I said. He thanked me, asking that we remember him in our prayers.     </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And the boy, also, if you remember. He is afraid. He knows America is a different place from Sicilia. I hope he can take it, as it is a different world, or I will have to send him back, as he has nowhere else to go.” He gives the boy a gentle push, sending him through the door. “Do not linger.” The boy did hesitate, and the uncle pushed again, and everything went well, and the uncle joked his nephew went in a boy and came out a man. By now, most of the men (I saw no women) were behind us, in a line against the wall. There was not enough room to get back to our beds, and we trampled over the blankets and the bags scattered about.      </p>
<p id="page_536" class="calibre6">I tell Enzo, “I will not last two weeks of this. I will sleep on the deck from now on,” but he laughed.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“In <i class="calibre5">Marzo</i>, on the sea?  At three in the morning? The wind can be freezing. <i class="calibre5">Antonino. </i>You must adapt to your surroundings. There is nothing you can do to make this trip easier. <i class="calibre5">Et vincet accommodare</i> is what I council.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What is that?” I ask. “What you said.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Et vincet accommodare. </i>It is Latin. It means ‘adapt and overcome.’” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“But we are penned up, like cattle. How will I sleep?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do your best.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“And this toilet. Even the <i class="calibre5">capu</i> gave me a bush. More privacy and the air is better.”       </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo smiled. “Your own bush?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Si, my own bush. Sometimes the best one. The fullest and the greenest.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">“You are an eloquent man, Antonino. Well said. And you have a sense of humor that I appreciate. There are a thousand in the gut of this ship. There <i class="calibre5">is</i> no privacy. There will be no privacy…for you, or me, or the rest, except for the people in first class…maybe second class, but I cannot say to that.” </p>
<p class="calibre6">He had humbled me. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“What you say…you are right. I will try my best.” He smiled and I believed he respected other men’s humility, but I do not believe he had humility of his own.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“That is what I want to hear,” he said, patting my shoulder. “I joined with you men because you work with your hands and understand privation.”  </p>
<p id="page_537" class="calibre6">“Privation? What is it?”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“<i class="calibre5">Privazione.</i>” When he uttered the word, he stretched it and the sound seemed forever. “<i class="calibre5">Priiiivazione</i>, my young friend, is what we have here.”  He looked about the room, at the grimy iron floors, the peeling green paint and the thirty, or so, men and women and children packed into a cargo hold, the smoking oil lamps and the fouled air.  “This is <i class="calibre5">privation</i>,” he said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The toilet stink he did not note, but I believed it to be part of ‘privation.’   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca was annoyed by the talk. “Privation, my ass,” he said.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“When do we eat. Do we live on air for two weeks?”   </p>
<p class="calibre6">Two men listened to our talk, <i class="calibre5">Giuseppe Moritti</i> and his son, <i class="calibre5">Micale</i>, from <i class="calibre5">Stacitti</i>, in Calabria, and this made them Calabrese, not Siclianu, but they were proud men, as I could tell.  <i class="calibre5">Micale</i> was blind in his right eye, from a bull’s horn, and it was an ugly thing to see when he  looked sideways. They were on this very boat before, and Giuseppe remarked it was no better, no cleaner, or the crew more civilized than the first time. But he liked the looks of the women, who were younger and rounder than on the first trip.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Luca was still agitated for the rumbling in his gut. “To hell with these women. What about food? We were promised food when we bought the tickets. Where is it?”      </p>
<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre5">Giuseppe</i> laughed with his son, the bigger fool of the two, and they were like hyena’s the way they carried on together. “You worry about food?” he says to Luca. “Sicilian men I know only worry about their cazzo…and what goat they can fuck.” <i class="calibre5">Giuseppe</i> and <i class="calibre5">Micale</i> laughed like the fools they were, and the son congratulates the father on the good joke he made. Luca moved toward Giuseppe, who was quick and still agile and stepped away. I grabbed Luca’s arm and he calmed down.  Giuseppe understood by the look on Luca’s face how close he came to a good beating, and the fool son never said a word or took a step to protect his fool father.    </p>
<p id="page_538" class="calibre6">I give this Giuseppe credit, that he saw his error in judgment and tried to ease the tension between him and Luca by changing the subject.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“There is not much food. The better among us will steal some in the next few weeks.”  </p>
<p class="calibre6">What there is, he recalled. Was cooked in the middle of the ship, and he guessed it might be put out and any moment, but this was only a guess, as it has been three years since he was on this boat. Luca relaxed, thinking more of his empty gut than beating this fool, Giuseppe. We left the cabin in search of food, while <i class="calibre5">Giuseppe</i> and <i class="calibre5">Micale</i> stayed back, saying they brought a little food and would not eat dog shit until they had no choice. That is what they said, but it was more a fear of Luca, and keeping out of his way.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">What I saw was like a religious procession at festa, lines leaving the cabins in search of food. Each man followed the man in front of him, and the hope was that the first man in line knew where he was going. We could have been walking into hell, but what did it matter, if there was food and the food was good, or if not good, there was enough.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">Enzo scratched his head. </p>
<p class="calibre6">“This is a problem. They cannot feed us at the same time. I hope there will be no trouble from the hotheads,” and what he said made sense, and it caused me worry. Luca heard it, about the hotheads, and knew Enzo was speaking of him.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“I eat now, not later,” he said, in his course way, loud enough that everyone who knew Luca, knew he would not be put off; a few clapped for him, a few patted his back. One man shook his head, and another hugged him. He was a hero, for nothing more than shooting off his mouth. We ate in a room behind a white iron door, well-guarded by a tall and hefty sailor, mean looking, who seemed German, but spoke decent <i class="calibre5">Italiano. </i> Enzo called him “the centurion,” that sounded vulgar the first time I heard him say it. Luca faced off with the guard, and there was a hundred hungry men at Luca’s back, but he was almost passive, if passive means peaceful, except he stiffened his chest for the benefit of the guard. </p>
<p id="page_539" class="calibre6">“When do we eat,” he demanded of the guard, who glared at Luca and planted his feet, looking him dead in the eye, and neither man flinched or looked away. “Cabin number?” the sailor asked, and he stiffened his chest, and it was a standoff.    </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Cabin number, my ass. We come to eat, and we are eating, me and my friends.” I pushed to the front of the line, nudging past a woman who refused to move, cursing me because I touched her body (her arm), but I admitted my mistake, and apologized.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“We are cabin “A” under the water,” I tell the sailor.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Under the water?” he says. “You mean third class?” and I nod to this.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“Cabin “A” eats now. The rest of you keep the noise down, and be orderly,” he said, leaning around Luca, and shouting to the line, but his orders and manner were not well received, and some men in the line, not from cabin” A,” were agitated and complained.   </p>
<p class="calibre6">“There are instructions in the cabins,” the guards shouts, “and if you do not read, find someone who does, because we will not nurse you for the next two weeks.” We protested that all the food would be gone, and some had children to feed.  A bit of a man pushed his way to the front and complained the papers in his cabin were written in some foreign language. German, he thought, and they should be written in Italian, but he admitted he could not read any language.  </p>
<p class="calibre6">The guard ordered him away and he left without further complaint.  Not much of a man, as I could see, to leave after such a small spat and with no satisfaction. Not much of a man.      </p>
<p class="calibre6">It was a small room, a <i class="calibre5">ripensamento</i>, an “afterthought,” Enzo believed, as cargo holds do not have dining rooms. It was about the size of our steerage cabin, same green walls, but no peeling paint. I counted ten boxes, used as tables for four, with barely enough room to move, or stretch. The boxes were unpainted, already blessed with a good coat of oil from the air. The nails had not been set and were sharp and rusting from the salt air. The chairs were small boxes and sat poorly and wobbled. The floor was iron, covered with oily wood planks and slippery, covered in a grime I had only seen in an army tool shop. A poor woman slipped as she walked to her table, but a man, her husband, I believe, caught her before she fell. The room smelled and this mattered to me. I complained on the crowding, like an animal pen, and you could not walk a step without bouncing off another human body, and this made the best of us, the gentlest of men, bad-tempered and ready to fight. Women were affected the same way, and this surprised me as they are better in crowds than men, not as easy to push into a fight, since it is in their nature to be gentler, so Enzo said, since nature has charged them with care of the children and a kinder nature was needed for such work. ‘It will get worse,’ I thought, as the days go on, and in a week, we will be enemies, and there will be a war every hour on the hour.  Not twelve hours on this ship, I am suffering from boredom, the bad air, and closeness of my fellow man. Maybe poor food, but I hoped it was not the case.      </p>
